AW_BIA.3.desc: "Orji Agu had gathered a conference call together, it was made up of military personnel, members of the legislature, business leaders, and several prominent activists who had made their opinions on the war extremely vocal even prior to the meeting.  Agu knew that the makeup of this strategy session was highly unorthodox, especially for him being in the formerly quiet position of “Deputy Advisor of Improving Biafran-Amazonian Relations”, and with his boss sick from food poisoning, he had to corral this video conference as best as he could.\nThe generals and military men had been stern and straightforward, they believed that a limited intervention was best, “We have just recovered from a war against Nigeria and another grueling war, despite how noble its intentions may be, should not be our focus right now.” stated the general, earning a few nods and some scornful glares from the rest of the call, “At the best, a limited intervention providing surplus munitions and material aid may be our best approach. Though we can leave it up to the politicians to try and hammer out an agreement between the aggressors in Cameroon-”\nThe general was cut off by a barrage of insults from one of the politicians in question, as well as a rude remark from an anti-imperialist activist, when the call had quieted itself down, one of the business leaders spoke her mind. “Ambazonia is not worth defending, at least, right now. I cannot risk losing contracts and clients in Cameroon over a petty language dispute or whatever it is sparking this war. We should focus on improving and expanding our economy over wasting our resources on this conflict.”\nThis did not go over well, immediately following her short speech, a member of the upper house made his point very clear. “Are you people stupid? Ambazonia is a sister nation to us, a group persecuted by their larger and brutish neighbor while they attempt to carve out a home for themselves. As we speak, women and children are dying out on the streets as military goons from Cameroon ravage their cities and countryside. Imagine if no one extended a hand to us when we were in our struggle against Nigeria, would we have hoped for such talks of civility and hesitancy from the world powers then? If we can win out against Nigeria of all countries, we can certainly protect our potential allies in Ambazonia against Cameroon.”\n\nIt was clear a turning point had been reached in the ongoing discourse, and thus, Orji Agu had prepared to make a statement…"

Many have claimed that a direct intervention would result in a loss of life that Biafra does not need. Many civilians have even campaigned outside government buildings, with slogans like “Why die for Buea?”. Others have also argued that an intervention could draw the ire of the international community and could end up backfiring horribly. "

Something felt strange about today, though. Most of these raids had subsided, and there were comments on local newspapers (of which she didn't read any, but her mom loves telling her all about the latest news, anyway) that the Port Harcourt 2nd Division had managed to take Oyo and had been approaching into Lagos. Smart girl she is, she knows that Lagos isn't Nigeria's capital - that would be Abuja - but regardless, losing either city would result in the total collapse of legitimacy for the war against Biafra.\n\nA knock rang against the classroom's door.

Kids began clapping and shouting the fatherland's name - some taking the moment to cause further mayhem and have fun. Afamefuna laid down her pencil at the table and put her hands in her face. The Nigerian bastards had tried five times now to destroy the dream of Biafra, to crush a free and democratic nation. The line had been held, every single time, and not once has Nigeria managed to ever again step in Enugu, Port Harcourt, or Benin City.

Fellow military staff members of the EMR had been waiting for too long now, as they've clearly begun prodding Bakano for some clarification on his contempt...\nSo thus, he laid down a big map of the EMR in front of the staff, and begun an enormous spiel:\n"Biafra's illegal and violent chauvinist secession had nearly threatened to dissolve Nigeria into many petty states. This simple truth provides clarity on the decisions of our Federal Republic's government in their blockade of the Biafran polity. Yet, this seemed to not be sufficient as aid came pouring in from Cameroon and other nations surrounding us, as if *we* were the aggressors, particularly after some fabrications and outright slander leaked out from the frontlines into Time magazine and other international media outlets. Regardless, a key thing we did was blockade all of Biafra's coast, and according to military plans, also blockade the border with Cameroon to encircle them. This failed once the Battle of Adamawa came to a Biafran victory, and the Republic of Benin held the line against us, impressively. Now, that Biafra has finally collapsed like the terrorist dogs they were, we can easily overpower their "partisans" and subsequently destroy any attempts at making an "exile" government of Biafra by arresting intellectuals and Biafran politicians, whilst executing the particularly troublesome folks."\n\nAfter Bakano had made his case, the officers begun discussing amongst themselves, with Bakano looking at them intently.

The waiter nodded, and moved his left hand to the people eating. People drinking soda and using their phones suddenly took pistols, knives, rifles out of their pockets and bags, immediately shooting down several EMR policemen.\n\nKanu had not said a word until that moment, and maintained silence alongside his comrades. His paramilitary unit here had enough numbers to make up a corps, and had quickly begun raiding EMR outposts. Once the Military Region command had figured out what was going on, it appeared that Kanu's paramilitary unit had grown into a few batallions, and that the city of Enugu, alongside Onitsha, Owerri and Umuahia had become besieged, or fell to several assorted Biafran or Biafran-aligned paramilitaries and forces."

Regardless, the meeting went on as usual and words were exchanged just like any other meeting. Neither of the diplomats had to worry on their words as the real weight of the conversation was placed on the translator as the Biafran diplomats had bribed the translator to make sure that they twisted their original words so that, in perfect japanese, the ego of the representatives was stroked massively, and could try and sweeten the deal so that more economic aid could be “ever so graciously used to benefit the blight of the Biafran government”. In actuality, the translator was incredibly amateur and made many mistakes which resulted from more laughs than we would have liked from the ambassadors.\n\nBut all in all, the specifics of this event do not matter.

As the war to defend Biafran independence dragged on, many of the newer soldiers could not be issued with adequate munitions or supplies. To circumvent this inadequacy, the fighting men of Biafra resorted to homemade methods of warfare.

True, trash in Nigeria and Biafra was usually burnt, and in cases where it wasn't, they were indeed thrown in the Delta. But this seemed like an amount that nobody was expecting.\n\nOf course, nobody was expecting the ferocity and violence of the Biafrans' revolt, either.\n\nGeorge Gosifechukwu had been busy at work buying trash by the penny and throwing it all at the Niger delta using tractors and cranes, mobilizing entire villages to pollute the river without most of them knowing. This was a much-needed distraction for the Nigerians. Of course, he wasn't alone - thousands of people made Nigerian soldiers pretend they're trash collectors by simply overloading the rivers with trash, whilst the backend of the operation promoted the theory that Nigerian forces were doing it to starve out the Biafran revolt. Due to a further experience with the Internet, Biafran agents had been better at convincing even Westerners of this theory, whilst Nigerian government ministers panicked to find a "cool" way of proving they were being targeted."

Since its occupation by Nigerian forces, the narrow alleys and streets were empty - only rats could be seen scampering across the street, looking for something to eat. But now that the soldiers had returned to their barracks, people finally found the courage to step out of their huts again. However, the masses became quiet again, as a single man started to walk down the smouldering roads, fearless of the potential attacks. A man in white robe and a red cap - Nnamdi Okwu Kanu.\n\nAlways staring forward and with his head slightly tilted downwards, he wandered along the houses, looking towards his countrymen and touching their shoulders.\n\n"Biafra is not dead. Biafra is not dead. Biafra is not dead."\n\nThus he droned on, like a Hare Krishna singing a mantra. He looked onto their eyes, smiling as his mantra catched onto the airs of the city.\n\nThe Igbos came first. Not that many, especially so far from the heartland of the Igbo homeland, yet they were there, and numerously they came to Kanu and chanted with him. The Edo masses begun coming close, too. As he circled around the city's squares, eventually gathering enough people to fill an apartment complex, Kanu stands atop a wooden pallet, screaming from the top of his lungs;\n“People of Biafra! The foreign invaders have taken away our country, our children! Our rightful soil! For far too long we've allowed ourselves to remain split, but Edo people, Igbo people, Ijaw people, Benue people, we are Biafrans and we cannot let the Fulani invader destroy our light.

Increasingly a more despotic and weak state, it was starting to become obvious that it had no future. Although he never spoke out against it - of course, for his own sake.\n\nHe was an officer in the Nigerian Army, and saw hundreds of soldiers under his command be killed by the Biafran insurrectionists through all kinds of tactics that the outdated Nigerian military had no concept of. With these feelings considered, it isn't surprising that despite being a relatively important chain of the Nigerian military command, Olorunyomi was eager to side with the Biafrans once the Federal Republic and the polity known as Nigeria had been dissolved.\nAs the North destroys itself, and the danger of Fulanization and Islamization of Yorubaland dissipated in the span of weeks, Olorunyomi knew he had to do something to preserve his homeland from violence from both sides, and despite Biafra's seizure of the Yoruba pearl, Éko, Lagos itself, it seemed that it was nescessary to work with what he had gotten, and became one of the primary creators of the Yoruba constitution and the Republic of Yorubaland. Despite being relatively unimportant in this new polity, having a cozy spot as mayor of Oyo, Olorunyomi realized that, at least, Yorubaland was free."

He knew that no matter how good of a deal he got, he would never be able to retrieve Nigeria's national glory, and that the pains of this meeting wouldn't ever leave his name.\n\nIgnatius Madukwe looked at Michael with contempt.

He blurted out, knowing that being rude wouldn't warrant much productivity.\n"Huh? Yeah, yeah."

The concession of 20% of all Nigerian oil companies of their assets every fiscal quarter... The immediate dissolution of the Nigerian military junta and transition into democratic, free and fair elections..."\nThe list went on and on.

She desperately picked up her papers, simultaneously begging for mercy and to leave peacefully.\nMadue Onyekachi did not care for the Governor. She was an instrument in Biafraland's former demise and allowed Fulanization to destroy Lagos' heritage. It didn't matter, though - orders from Kanu himself demanded the dissolution of Lagos' primary Yoruba architecture and culture to etch the city into a beacon and outpost of the Igbo people. These thoughts sprinted through Madue's head and the practical conclusion of them was-\nOpeyemi Oke had been pushed away and fell on the marbled ground of her office. Her head hit the floor like a coconut and she immediately stopped responding. Still breathing, which relieved Madue and his comrades somewhat.\n"Look what you did, dumbass! Chikelu will get mad at us." said one of his buddies, picking up some documentation and flipping through it, then putting it back on the filing cabinet.\n"It's fine. She isn't important now and won't be later either," Madue retorted, defending his actions. He dragged the woman out of the office, placing her in a chair out of the building.\n"She's going to wake up, don't you think?

No government, from Paul Biya's Cameroon to Monguno's Nigeria could stop the Biafran onslaught at their enemies.\n\nThe initial failures of the Biafran democracy to defend itself one more time against the Nigerians had proven to be the death knell of Biafra's democracy, as the new government was formed out of insurrectionists fighting for a free Biafra that was strong - one that could defend itself, so its children could live in peace and happiness once and for all.\n\nAnd really, Nnamdi Kanu, the newest President of Biafra, had succeeded in all this. He'd create one of the best standards of living in Africa and increased Biafra's GDP. Despite everything, Biafra's insistence on petroleum and natural gas extraction actually worked out well for them when selling to less developed countries that don't have renewable infrastructure and can't afford them yet. Many of his detractors say this prosperity, then, is made out of borrowed time, and soon enough Biafra's debts and GDP growth will stunt and collapse.\n\nYet, people right now, and probably for the next few decades, live well.

As these moments of quiet had slowly subsided, something unexpected had sprung up: Dozens of small, improvised synagogues for the Biafran soldiers had been created, and mosques were being repurposed. Christians were tolerated, and as the dust settled, many citizens had become fine with the occupation.

They had also shared the experience of toiling under the oppressive yoke of the Nigerians, and this tied the sister republics even closer together.\n\nAt the military base, Igbo and Edo marched in lock-step with one another, ate at the same mess halls, and told each other stories of their homes.

Despite everything, especially despite all the aggressions Nigeria had done against the Biafran people, democracy remained as the constant, and this element of the Rising Sun of Africa brought all Biafrans together. Yet, a democracy is not made by a single party - it has people that oppose the government, critics and cross-aisle communication. The APGA, knowing that this tendency of opposition in full democracies could result in the snuffing of Biafra's democracy in the crib, decided to dislodge much opposition through the annexation and merging of other parties, especially due to "larger emergencies" occuring due to Nigeria's constant raids and attacks.\n\nHowever, Nigeria seemed to have finally been defeated in all fronts and senses, with little holding the country together and little motivation being given to send more young men to die in a war against the Biafrans. Having this success gave a newfound peace to the Biafran people, who had long felt the suffering of war choking their nation. Thus, calls for reform had begun, and the citizenry begun wondering if the state of affairs of a dominant-party democracy needed to continue...\n\nInitially the government was very skeptical of this development, but many within the APGA itself realized that, if they are to follow with their ideals that brought the Biafrans together, they must lay down from their throne and allow the future of Biafra to be etched by popular mandate.\n\nThus, the latest election has actually resulted in the first minority APGA government since 1970, composed of the APGA and the Grassroots Democratic Movement, with the All-Biafran Igboland National Salvation Movement, Labour Party and the National Interest Party as the opposition."

Poverty is still widespread and homelessness rears its ugly head across almost every city in Biafra.\n\nTo remedy this blight on the nation, the ‘Vision 2030’ program has been formed. The program lists a series of proposals and reforms to modernise and diversify the Biafran economy and eliminate the societal ills facing our nation by 2030. In the realm of agriculture, the 2030 program seeks to eliminate the remnants of subsistence farming and encourage the diversification of agricultural produce. In the realm of urban industry, it seeks to eliminate unemployment through the construction of new cities and with it, opportunities for work. Furthermore, Biafra has been enslaved by the price of oil. While bringing much wealth to the country, it is a double edged sword. A fluctuation in the price of oil would be a catastrophe for our economy. Therefore, we must, by developing industry, diversify our industry as well to form a reliable rock on which our economy may sit.\n\nBut perhaps, the greatest and most ambitious project of the programme is the construction of an entirely new capital city.

Even if the recent snap election was just a dumb theatrical motion to keep APGA's position, it didn't mean it wasn't important.\n\nRegardless, millions of Biafrans were lacking many things that seemed so close to possibility - having a car, having a good mobile phone, having a videogame console. A country so rich with oil and other resources couldn't let its potential die out by conservatism and boring same-old solutions to longtime problems. What Biafrans needed was change, and many were voting in droves for it. At least Madukaife believed so.\n\nJelany sat down in his couch and grabbed a serving of his fufu, dipping it into soup and eating it with cutlery - a somewhat unconventional choice, but mostly for the sake of keeping the couch clean.\nAs the TV went on about provinces and their results, it seemed that things were coming to a cusp when the election was becoming incredibly close, and representatives across several provinces had elected an almost 49/51 majority for the APGA. All that was missing was Enugu. Jelany knew those bastards were wildcards, and that you couldn't ever be sure what they were going to do. And so, as suspense hazed the air, Jelany heard the following words..."

Of course these criticisms are not exclusive to the President's frustrations, but also includes the increasingly large Biafran opposition to APGA, the country's ruling block since the 70s. Nnamani, too, is tired. The Presidency has been getting to him, and having the burden of an invasion in his term has not been kind to him. His service to Biafra is coming close to its best before date and he'd probably prefer to end his Presidency in a high note anyway, considering the next elections are coming soon regardless and it gives him less room for gaffes or other follies of a man that's exhausted.\n\nAll things considered, the case for a snap election is very strong.

Another option is Ojukwuville as an homage to our founding father and first president. I’d say that these two are pretty much my favorites.” he said and started to click with his pen again.\n“But what about the other options?

They’re sending in a consultant with some mock-ups, and we get to choose. This one’s for all the marbles, we’re… finally… almost done here.” Chioma deflated, sinking into her chair.\nNot long after, a stern gentleman entered with a bundle of sturdy, government approved poster board. The options were laid out in front of them, with a complimentary terse description given for each of the options.\nThe first, to emulate Brasília - relatively new itself - and focus on a modernist, car-centric aesthetic. A decidedly reasonable choice. Halimnye imagined himself speeding down the highway late at night after another day at this painful job. He nodded slowly.\nThe second option more so emulated Amsterdam, to push the imagination and opt instead for magnificent spires of glass and neo-futuristic innovation. Inspiring, but absolutely expensive. In turn, Chioma imagined herself atop a glass skyscraper, a robot bringing her sparkling water as she looked upon the people walking down the street. She smirked.\nThe third of the presented choices was decidedly more cultural, opting to invoke Addis Ababa or Alexandria, ensuring to incorporate the Igbo spirit holistically. Another promising choice, certainly down to earth. With the repeated wars to protect their land and their people, both Halimnye and Chioma recognized the solemn appeal of this option, glancing at each other before returning to the presentation.\nNot long after, the consultant wrapped up his presentation, checking his watch.

Of course Enugu, because it already is our capital and then we wouldn’t have to move, Port Harcourt as a way to advocate ethnic pluralism, move to “the heart of Igboland” and put the capital close to Owerri or expand Bonny Island and drain land there to show other nations what Biafra is capable of.”\nHalimnye wrote all the locations they had picked on sheets of paper, stood up and walked to the pin board.

In a way, he was correct.\nFollowing the end of the 5th Biafro-Nigerian war, Kareem found himself in newly annexed Biafran land following yet another victory for the Southerners. He hotly contemplated fleeing in the same manner of much of his neighbours but eventually decided against the plan, thinking it an unacceptable trial to subject his newborn son to. Within year's end, the dirt road running through the town was paved. "Probably just them making it easier to funnel troops through", he thought. Then, the government came to give the villagers access to the internet. "They're just keeping tabs on us", he told his wife, though he was less sure now. When his employer, now officially registered, informed Kareem that he was to be laid off, the government even gave him cash to get back on his feet. "They're trying to placate you", the voice, now withered and tiny, whispered again. Using his new internet, he began searching for jobs. His finger slipped, accidentally clicking on that new city they were building down south.\nA month later, Kareem and his family were leaving the place of their births towards the shiny new capital of [GetBiaCapital], and deep in his heart this did feel like a betrayal of his people. His brain reminded him that the salary was 30,000 Biafran pounds a month. With a single look back and some speedy farewells they stepped onto the shiny new bus, packed with those in the same situation."

He usually spent his days playing Minesweeper or Solitaire on the device - but he could have sworn that he never had to do an “Update” before. He did not exactly know what it was, only that his computer took way longer to start than usual and that these weird dancing dots had never been before on his screen. But eventually, after a long while, the old man’s desktop was revealed.\nBut here as well. Something was different. It hadn’t been this sleek and 3D before, right? And what were all of those new things! Actively trying to understand what was going on, he clicked on a new icon that simply said “Internet Explorer”. He had heard of that “Internet” before. It was the top talk for the last few weeks for his grandson and his friends that sometimes met at his kitchen table to ask about his service during the war of indepence. He just assumed that it was some sort of circus or wandering trader coming to town, but didn’t understand it at all.\nThe new thing on his computer had finally opened a window but overwhelmed by what seemed like hundreds or thousands of small buttons, he closed it again and closed his tired eyes behind the thick pair of glasses. As he finally opened them again, he noticed something else. Usually, there was always a crossed-out circle on the bottom right corner - but not anymore. For whatever reason it now showed 2… no wait, now 3 weird bars, all varying in size. And right next to that was now the small picture of a sun and a “29°” underneath it. Chijioke looked to his right where his window was. Sunny. And the thermometer hanging right next to it said 29°.\nWithout any real aim, he clicked on one of the small buttons and after a few seconds of more dancing dots, something opened. A gallery of some sorts. A click on a familiar face later, and he immediately recognized his grandson smiling at him from behind the screen. That was too much for the old man and he turned the window off again. That was enough for him and he opened Minesweeper.\nAnd once again, he was greeted by another design, more buttons and text. Enraged, he also closed that window. It was clearly not his day. As a final decision, he opened Solitaire but immediately closed it again after he saw the words “Battle-Solitaire”.

That situation however was common for the entire region of the country, which caused ever more tensions as more and more could access the network to tell their story in this world. And to say that everyone was blind to that would be a misunderstanding. As the excavators roared, creating large trenches which blocked a large portion of those slums, many had to improvise with the bridges while the work was ongoing, however as soon as the pipes were installed, not a lot could realize the changes it would bring. Surprisingly enough, the water did not had a taste now, as it should be. The sewages smelled a bit nicer as well, and occasionally one could even see lights after dark.

Rather, it was the government in Enugu demanding an immediate meeting regarding the recent invasion of Ambazonia by Cameroon.\n\nWait, what?\n\nAbba shuffled his papers a bit and kept trying to find information about this - little could be found besides tweets and some blog posts, but it seems the Biafran government figured out something was fishy from the noises near the border.

BIA_liberation_of_the_south: "Liberation of the South"
BIA_liberation_of_the_south_desc:0 "For too long were our brothers in the South enslaved by the laws of Sharia. But thanks to our brilliant operation, Nigeria is broken apart for good, her capital lays in ruins and her army is nothing more but a scattered group of unarmed and disillusioned fanatics. However this doesnt means that our struggle is over. Our new friends require aid to properly function, and who is there but us to provide it?"
BIA_embracing_our_sister_republics: "Embracing Our Sister Republics"
BIA_embracing_our_sister_republics_desc:0 "Like Prometheus, the chains were broken and the people now breathe free from the Islamic yoke. The coast of former dictatorship is now full of young democracies which look to us as their protectors. So why should we shy away from this grandeur? Let us embrace our new friends! Enugu! Benin City! Ibadan! Lagos! Four cities united forever in our brotherhood of African solidarity! For Freedom, Prosperity and Democracy!"
BIA_united_in_faith: "United in Faith"
BIA_united_in_faith_desc:0 "What was the difference between North and South of Nigeria? It is a simple question to answer, first and foremost it is faith. While many in the north break their forehead while bowing to the will of Meccah and Medina, the south looked upon Rome and Jesus as their Saviour. Now, with Abuja's claws broken, our brothers may no longer shy away from the light of God. No matter-Catholic, Lutheran, Prothestant, Calvinist, Baptist or Orthodox, we shall stand as one in our devotion to salvation."
BIA_united_in_freedom: "United in Freedom"
BIA_united_in_freedom_desc:0 "There was a clear line that split Nigeria in 2. In the north, all men were bound to strict fundamentalism, chained to mundane traditions, authority and strict hierarchies. South however, was a beacon of market and personal freedom, with casinos of Lagos hosting Africa's most wealthy businessmen, and its ports unloading most exotic goods every day that couldnt be found in the north. When many people hear the word Africa, they imagine petty dictatorships that silence all dissent. Let us prove them wrong, let us show them the Africa of liberty in our image!"
BIA_united_against_oppression: "United against Oppression"
BIA_united_against_oppression_desc:0 "We are all Africans, we saw what supremacy of one over others does and we have plenty of examples to show the world. British. French and Nigerian machinations left our Ivory Coast in shambles, but we will not let that happen again! Our struggle against Oppression is not over just yet, one fell but the continent is still full of other tyrants. Future may be bleak for many, but not us, and while our words are noble, they must be strenghtened by action, thus we shall make..."
BIA_treaty_of_mutual_defense: "Treaty of Mutual Defense"
BIA_treaty_of_mutual_defense_desc:0 "A Common Defense Treaty. While our actions certainly sparked a wave of optimism for Africa, same couldnt be said of the general world. Superpowers who still hold their interest on the continent dont seem to approve the breakup of one of the largest continental economics and political centers. For now, we should make our moves carefully, and such act would calm everyone down at least somewhat. Besides, we dont have money for something greater either way..."
BIA_a_commonwealth_of_independent_states: "A Commonwealth of Independent States"
BIA_a_commonwealth_of_independent_states_desc:0 "A Policy to integrate our friends into the family that is Africa properly! Railways and asphalt shall be our skeleton! Ports and hubs shall be our veins! A common market shall be our heart and a common currency shall be our blood! Who cares what others may say? Prosperity shall quickly flow into our land, and the war will be but a distant memory. On the patriotic side of things, the commonwealth would also increase prestige of Biafra by building us a block of loyal allies on the world stage."
BIA_aiding_african_liberation_movements: "Aiding African Liberation Movements"
BIA_aiding_african_liberation_movements_desc:0 "For too long Africa was put to sleep, letting others to mutilate her body. What once was an organic collection of tribes and kingdoms was divided bt artificial lines set by European powers, ruining this harmony which Africa now has to bear with. Even worse, some of those former masters outright refused to leave our continent alone! But while suffering of our kin is immense, from Algeria to Capetown there exists a whole plethora of anti-colonial, revolutionary and in general-anti establishment movements of all colours and stripes. We may not agree with every one of them, but it is our duty as free men to aid in their liberation of not just theirs, but our common Homeland."
BIA_rising_sun_of_africa: "Rising Sun Of Africa"
BIA_rising_sun_of_africa_desc:0 "What defines a political reality within every continent? A presence of regional, or even global power that has its reach on its own sphere that surrounds it, allowing for great political machinations. Africa however, lacks this power, even more-it is in sphere of other powers. However, this very moment shall end this unfair deal. Biafra has proven to the world that Africa can and will change. While many of our continentals suffer from poverty, authoritarianism and lack of initiative, we are standing on the level of Europe in all of those things. Time to declare ourselves a nation on equal footings with United States and the Soviet Union, time to become a shining beacon for all of Africa!"

BIA_benin_our_greatest_friend_desc:0 "Diplomacy is such fragile thing that there exist no true enemies and true friends. But, sometimes there may be exceptions.The people which now breathe free are isolated from the world. So, why shouldnt we embrace this friendship for our mutual benefit? Trade always led to enrichment of both sides and military cooperation may save us from...future potential threats."
BIA_beaten_back_but_not_lost: "Beaten Back But Not Lost"
BIA_preparing_for_the_next_war: "Preparing For The Next War"
BIA_preparing_for_the_next_war_desc:0 "Nigeria is a country of fools, but brave fools nonetheless. They wouldnt come for our souls five times if they had no hope of breaking us. Right now there may be no threat, we can rest assured. But what will happen in one, five or ten years?  Our rivalry will end only when the world itself will collapse and until then, we must be sure that whatever comes-Biafra could hold on."
BIA_maintaining_morale: "Maintaining Morale"
BIA_maintaining_morale_desc:0 "Yes, we lost and it is pointless to deny the truth, but who said we must deliver it unconditionally? Our people has the right to know how situation really is, and right now, we are the only reliable source. It wouldnt hurt to sooth the pain with some reports of our tactical victories, individual heroes and...did we even lost, if the main cause of the war-our independence, has been secured?"
BIA_investing_in_the_arms_industry: "Investing in the Arms Industry"
BIA_investing_in_the_arms_industry_desc:0 "With our war over, the market begins to stabilize, and our incomes are finally rising. We have already planned out the budget for reconstruction, compensations and reorganization of our government. But its better if some of it would be redirected towards our military. While the recent conflict was relatively quick, it would be better if the next one will be over much sooner, and for what we must maintain our army's top quality at all times."
BIA_diversifying_our_contractors: "Diversifying Our Contractors"
BIA_diversifying_our_contractors_desc:0 "In so far, most of our weaponry comes from either the Hebrew Republic of Labor or the Seychellois. While this brings forth standartization, it also limits our supplies sources, as well as puts us in critical danger especially that our main source of weapons is now in a state of civil war. But money can solve anything. Tula Factory, Beretta, FNS, and others would greatly appreciate if we sort out a few contracts with them. Its best that if the day of war comes again, we can shoot back one hundred shells in exchange for one from the enemy!"
BIA_safeguarding_biafra: "Safeguarding Biafra"
BIA_safeguarding_biafra_desc:0 "We have won, thats for sure. But we also suffered greatly during the war and that is difficult to deny. However, the war gave us necessary experience when it comes to both tactics and strategy. We can use them to our advantage, given our previous victories and seeming weakness of Abuja to reform its army properly. Lines of fortifications, drones, minefields, schemes of defensive and offensive operations, no price is too high to keep Nigerian boots from trampling our soil."
BIA_a_peoples_army: "A People's Army"
BIA_a_peoples_army_desc:0 "What differs Nigerian Army from ours? It is but one simple fact-our Army is built to serve the people first and foremost. Not leaders or ideologies, but the wellbeing of our nation. From that principle comes the other one. Everyone in our nation has the right to serve in the armed forces, regardless of their own beliefs, for they know what they are fighting for. For Freedom! For Liberty! For Biafra!"
BIA_revanchist_ambitions: "Revanchist Ambitions"
BIA_revanchist_ambitions_desc:0 "The people are getting ever more angry at our recent failrue, but this emotion can be used for the good of our cause. Let them rage, not against us, but against the fanatics of Abuja, the fat cats of Lagos and those who did not took up arms to defend their Fatherland. We will find a proper scapegoat soon enough, but for now, let us indulge into the dreams of our future glorious reconquista. What was rightfully ours will return to us sooner or later or...maybe even a bit more."
BIA_military_first_policy: "Military First Policy"
BIA_military_first_policy_desc:0 "We cant let Nigeria to overcome us again, otherwise they will push us into the sea. The recent war has proven that the only thing capable of holding the enemy back is a strong and well-fed army. For it, our military budget must be expanded...no, it must be multiplied so that our army would put an army of any superpower to shame. Yes, sacrifices must be made and we will have to cut some fat as well. But the people that dont feed their army will soon feed the foreign one."
