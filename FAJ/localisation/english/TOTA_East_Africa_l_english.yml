EAF_newborn_nation_desc:0 "The East African Federation came into being in 2018, 2 years after the East African Confederation was proclaimed as a transitional measure to the eventual formation of a Federation. The vision of a newly-formed African superpower had been realized, partially with the intense backing of Muammar Gaddafi who saw it as a stepping stone towards the dreamed-of United States of Africa. Despite the large amounts of backers, donors, and enthusiastic people across the lands of the former countries of Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, Kenya and South Sudan, the whole operation was slightly botched and rushed, with many people surprised to see the speedy proccess of creating the new Federation, surprising for the level of corruption seen in some African countries comparatively. The agreed-on method of picking a Head of State was to put every single former head of state of each member country in a ballot, and have them run under ad-hoc parties created in mere weeks. The proccess had somehow worked well, but it certainly left its mark - hundreds of border outposts still exist with old country names, websites are still updating themselves to include the new East African Federation despite total international recognition, and millions of documents need updating and looking into. Despite having about 3 years of time to work it out, the East African Federation has not achieved anything close to a solidified identity, but the optimisim surrounding the possibility of a juggernaut nation in East Africa is infectious."
EAF_linguistic_split_desc:0 "Even if we are to ignore the thousand or so languages spoken by local tribes and villages across the territory of the East African Federation, all of them completely different and often unintelligible to eachother - foreign-brought languages like Swahili, French and English are also completely different to eachother, so the former "lingua-francas" of commerce in the member states of the Federation are now forced to comply with using these three languages in all legal documenmts, in all signs and in all websites. This has taken an immense toll on local governments and particularly has caused problems for representation of the other languages that aren't part of the "Big Three". Education amongst these languages has dwindled a fair bit as kids are taught far more the languages that are seen as giving better life prospects. This is particularly seen by more conservative East Africans as a destruction and disintegration of their local identities and cultures into an artificial trilingual society. Whilst most people, particularly the young, didn't have much interest in local languages anyway, it certainly has become even more irrelevant as the country rarely provides documents and legal assistance in local languages, resulting in increasingly large cultural and generational drifts and division."
EAF_overwhelming_poverty_desc:0 "Making the largest country in Africa on the map didn't really solve those former countries' massive wealth disparities, poverty, lack of health infrastructure and many other problems. Proponents do often state that, having united, things will get much better through streamlined and collective infrastructure policy, but it doesn't mean these issues have disappeared, or that they will at any point for a while."
EAF_sudan_sinkhole_desc:0 "South Sudan was practically the poorest, most unstable and most desperate member of the East African Community since its entry, so it's not entirely surprising that after its entry into the East African Federation, South Sudan had completely collapsed into dozens of warlords and fiefdoms, with the capital Juba becoming particularly violent. The newly-built federal army and ragtag paramilitaries had quickly quelled conflict in Juba proper and its surrounding areas near the border, the rest of South Sudan was intentionally left to its own devices due to the simple fact that an intervention would bankrupt the Federation. Tens of thousands arrive every month as refugees to the territory of the East African Forces in South Sudan, and little has been done to accomodate them well - with ad-hoc "refugee camps" being little more than a big tent with some blankets in a grassy floor. In any case, the EAFISS need to act at some point if they are to maintain their legitimacy as a Federation-wide Army, keeping the EAF's territory sovereign, indivisible, and peaceful."
POLITICS_SSD_COMPLETE_CHAOS_DESC:0 "South Sudan has been in total anarchy since the creation of the East African Federation, particularly due to ethnic conflict and accusations of supremacy of certain groups over others. Fundamentally, this means that no internationally recognized authority has been allowed into anywhere outside of the capital of South Sudan, Juba, currently under a contingent of East African forces.\n\nClans, warlords, tribes, fiefdoms, all fighting eachother to the death for the right of the mantle of South Sudan's legitimate government. Some distant pockets even cry out for negotiations and talks with the EAF, muddled by the sound of gunfire."

WNE.47.t: "Al-Shabaab Invaded By East African Federation [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.47.desc:0 "Citing funding of Islamists in East Africa and chaos in the Jubaland border, the East African Federation has initiated skirmishes and attacks against the Al-Shabaab government, formally identified as the Emirate of Somalia. This has been extremely polarizing in the world stage and in the public, with some calling it a blatant imperialist move by Paul Kagame, and others believing it to be an extremely important step forward in ending Islamist tyranny in Somalia and creating a stable government in the region."
WNE.47.a:0 "Taking a page from the American foreign policy notebook!"
WNE.46.t: "East African Gambit Succeeds [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.46.desc:0 "The EAF, widely seen as an extremely important actor in Africa's diplomacy and foreign policy, has succeeded in their invasion of the Emirate of Somalia, severely weakening Al-Shabaab's hold on Somalia, as EAF forces form a military administration of the region, as to eventually transfer it to the UN-backed Republic of Somalia. It appears that Al-Shabaab's previous stronghold has been wiped out, and now it walks in one leg..."

WNE.45.desc:0 "The East African Federation has gone through a humiliating defeat against an insurgent group in Somalia, the Al-Shabaab, which has been backing Islamist organizations and militias in the country, particularly in Tanzania and Kenya. Paul Kagame has published a statement of unity today, and that this fight is not over. However, the self-identified Emirate of Somalia has found new strength in this victory, with border conflicts flaring up in the formerly-quiet Horn of Africa..."

SSD_instability: "Made For War And Not Much Else"
SSD_instability_desc: "The entire territory of the short-lived Republic of South Sudan has found itself, save for Juba, in complete anarchy. Ethnic militias defend themselves against cults and unifying governments alike, rump states seek ambitions of unifying the whole territory and petty states vie for days of glory. Who will come out of this standing?"

 SEY_antifascist_operations: "Anti-Fascist Operations"
 SEY_antifascist_operations_desc: "Much of the world is mired in conflict now. And many of these conflicts see the growing threat of Fascism. But where there is Fascism, those who realise its depravity and evil nature are not too far behind. Let us extend a hand to those brave souls who struggle against the Fascist dogs and give them much needed support and manpower."
 SEY_to_russia_with_love: "To Russia With Love"
 SEY_to_russia_with_love_desc: "Our goal of revolutionary internationalism has attracted the attention of generals and intellectuals in Moscow. By developing our diplomatic relations with the USSR, we will be able to secure greater funding and military support. Not only increasing our stability and prosperity at home via Soviet aid and support, but also allowing for the development of our military as a modern fighting force, capable of supporting revolutions anywhere."
 SEY_honour_among_thieves: "Honour Among Thieves"
 SEY_honour_among_thieves_desc: "Mercenaries have had a long standing reputation of being self-serving fools who cannot be trusted. And in truth, this is not inaccurate. To repair our reputations, we will need to reform the rank and file of our armies. To do this, we shall aim to create an honour code. One that guarantees rights, respect, and just treatment to POWs, bar looting and pillaging and a pledge to follow the international rules of law."
 SEY_interbloc_diplomacy: "Inter-Bloc Diplomacy"
 SEY_interbloc_diplomacy_desc: "It is not just the USSR that is capable of giving us support in our endeavours. There is also the rest of the Warsaw Pact and Socialist bloc. From the Prussians, to Poland, to Yugoslavia. We must bolster our diplomatic relations with these nations and in doing so bring new perspectives and allies to the table. Who knows? Maybe we will get a fair share of volunteers and advisors from the East as well?"
 SEY_the_kgbs_strongest_soldiers: "The KGB's Strongest Soldiers"
 SEY_the_kgbs_strongest_soldiers_desc: "Within Seychelles are many representatives of different states and companies looking to use our services for their own benefit. While our taking power has interrupted this business to some extent, we have a new opportunity. Some have floated the idea of not only selling state secrets to the USSR and the KGB from documentation left by agents and representatives now long gone. Moreover, we have given offers to the KGB to set up shop here in Seychelles, through which they may easily be able to keep an eye on the different actors that come and go. A haven for spies, we will be able to give the USSR a significant edge in the Information Wars of the modern day."
 SEY_smo_honduras: "SMO Honduras"
 SEY_smo_honduras_desc: "War has broken out once again in Central America. This time between El Salvador and Honduras. Honduras in an unacceptable act of aggression has waged war against the nation of El Salvador. Under the leadership of greedy fat-cats and fascist despots, Honduras wages war on the innocent men and women of Central America. There is only one course of action here. To send our support to those victims of imperialism and aggression, wherever they may be!"
 SEY_smo_iraq: "SMO Iraq"
 SEY_smo_iraq_desc: "Iraq has been embroiled in conflict and civil war. The most pressing threat there is the Islamic State. A theocratic Islamist organisation who has killed hundreds if not thousands of people. The threat to Iraq is great, thus it is imperative we support those men of Iraq who bravely stand against the Islamic State.\nNot only that, but in the North lies the Kurds. Who for so long have struggled for freedom, Socialism, and independence. We must also support them in any way we can against those who seek to rob her of freedom."
 SEY_smo_south_africa: "SMO South Africa"
 SEY_smo_south_africa_desc: "Close to home is the conflict in South Africa. The Boers in Orania and the Cape are waging war on the Black Africans. Especially the Boers up North! Stories of massacres and lynchings are common there. And in reaction, the Black population fights with great, untold vigour against the Boer Neo-Nazis! They are natural allies to us. We will do well to start an operation in South Africa to ensure the triumph of Socialism and Anti-Fascism in Africa."
 SEY_smo_alaska: "SMO Alaska"
 SEY_smo_alaska_desc: "In Alaska, the USSR has taken up a brave mission. The Fascist so-called “Fiumans” have risen up and seized control of much of the state of Alaska. Fortunately, an anti-fascist Special Military Operation in Alaska has been executed by the USSR. Indigenous Alaskans and Alaskan Creoles have been fighting alongside the Red Army against these Fascist dogs. It is imperative that we send our men over there and ensure that the snake of Fascism lies still and dead."
 SEY_smo_america: "SMO America"
 SEY_smo_america_desc: "Now that we've gone over Alaska, we may continue our anti-fascist project to all of America, supporting the American Revolutionary Committee to expunge fascists from the face of the New World!"
 SEY_moving_beyond_nationhood: "Moving Beyond Nationhood"
 SEY_moving_beyond_nationhood_desc: "For many, many years, the Seychelles have been little more than a territory ruled by private military contractors. Those natives who opposed this were right to do so! But they came at it from the wrong angle. Those blinded by greed and money have been dethroned, but we cannot risk those short-sighted demagogues who can think only of blind nationalism seizing control. What we are is not some territory of mercenaries. Not any more. We shall not rule over the natives with whips and chains. But we will not become a mere nation. We will rise and pass into something far beyond it. A tool with which to craft and ensure the liberation of all across the world. We shall forge the unity of man from here."
 SEY_civilianization_of_government: "Civilianization of Government"
 SEY_civilianization_of_government_desc: "The time is finally right, with the initial needed steps taken, to begin the civilianization of our government. Local elections have started to take place across the nation. The people smile and sing like the times before the  rule of the mercenaries began. Peace and freedom has come home at last!"
 SEY_rewiring_our_connections: "Rewiring Our Connections"
 SEY_rewiring_our_connections_desc: "One of the more troubling consequences of the old order is that many organisations within the country, and many structures of the state, have strong connections to anti-Communist nations such as the USA, South Vietnam and South Africa. This obviously can not do. We must first of all start by cutting off these wires and chains. There is always the risk of subversion and reaction if we do not act quickly enough.\nSecondly, we will need to forge our connections with Socialist project across the world. From the USSR, to China, to Cuba. New connections will be made, and our re-alignment shall be complete at last."
 SEY_centralization_of_the_republic: "Centralization of the Republic"
 SEY_centralization_of_the_republic_desc: "The bureaucracy of this Republic is in a sorry state indeed. Different parts of the country do not even pay the same rates for taxes for the same thing! Administration is disconnected and confused. We must work towards centralising and streamlining our government. Cutting the fat, firing the corrupt, and making the engine of our nation roar!"
 SEY_saluton_al_la_mondo: "Saluton al la Mondo"
 SEY_saluton_al_la_mondo_desc: "The push and development of a pan-humanist worldview will require a monumental effort for complete cultural revolution. But we would not be here today if it could not be done! So hello to the world! Not the world of the bourgeoise. But the true world that lies hidden within us. One that calls and beckons for us to abandon these fake borders and national myths and to join as one indivisible human race. United in language, in culture, and a wish for prosperity and freedom!"
 SEY_antifascism_in_practice: "Anti-Fascism In Practice"
 SEY_antifascism_in_practice_desc: "Anti-Fascism cannot end with opposition to these destroyers of man at home! Fascism anywhere is a threat to humanity everywhere! We must keep an eye on the world stage and conflicts therein. Wherever the Brownshirts show their rotten, sorry heads, we will be there to smash them back into the ground.\nCertain divisions have already been growing in contact with Socialist organisations across the world where the threat of Fascism is ever-present. Let these tormentors cower in fear! For we will not allow them to rise and work unopposed. Solidarity with all who suffer at the hands of Fascism, and death to all those who champion it!"
 SEY_killing_mccarthys_ghost: "Killing McCarthy's Ghost"
 SEY_killing_mccarthys_ghost_desc: "The soldiers of other rival factions within Seychelles have not up and vanished. And neither have anti-Communists within Seychelles’ natives. There are reports of suspected Communists being harassed and attacked. The ghost of McCarthy and the Red Scares have come to haunt Seychelles, it would seem. It is time to erase these reactionary centres completely. We will not allow these festering blights of reaction and Fascism to stay within us. Before the reaction can devour us, we will drive them out."
 SEY_one_common_language: "One Common Language"
 SEY_one_common_language_desc: "One of the biggest dividers and barriers for common human identity is that of language. We are not the first to realise this. It was Zamenhof who dreamed of a humanity connected by one language, Esperanto. It is this which will open us up to new venues of interconnectedness and understanding. Thus we shall announce Esperanto to be a common, official language. It will take a while, for sure. A few generations will have to come and go before this is established. But the result will be a beautiful thing indeed."
 SEY_new_curriculums: "New Curriculums"
 SEY_new_curriculums_desc: "The children are the future. And if we wish to solidify our revolution in politics, society and culture, we will need to form a new curriculum in this country. One that will teach a new common language of Esperanto. One that will discard the Anti-Communist mythmaking of old and emphasise the history of Socialist struggle to instil in the youth, a strong dedication to the cause of Socialism and opposition to Fascism and nationalism."
 SEY_just_getting_started: "Just Getting Started"
 SEY_just_getting_started_desc: "With these manoeuvres, we have secured a strong foothold in this nation for our revolution. But we are not near done! There is still much work to be done. An upheaval of the economy and fostering of communal, socialised ownership, of land and capital! A true Socialist project shall commence. Our islands shall leap and jump into new vistas of ever-growing possibilities!"
 SEY_first_five_year_plan: "First Five Year Plan?"
 SEY_first_five_year_plan_desc: "Much of the country is underdeveloped and agrarian. Some parts don’t have reliable access to electricity and internet. If we are to prove a good alternative to the past regimes, we must pursue a policy of development and industrialisation. The first of possibly many five year plans will begin as a result. Industrial capacity will grow and multiply many times over. The wonders of the modern world and of technology will be a beacon of light for us all. The slums will run away and a new utopia will be made here."
 SEY_switching_the_lever: "Switching The Lever"
 SEY_switching_the_lever_desc: "In theory, the mercenaries of Seychelles are loyal to no flag. Only to money. But of course, this has never really been the case. You’d be hard pressed to find the mercenaries of old fighting alongside the Viet Cong! These PMCs were servants of Capital. Now, we are here! And we shall assert a new vision as servants of the revolution and the workers everywhere."
 SEY_the_free_seychellois_youth: "The Free Seychellois Youth"
 SEY_the_free_seychellois_youth_desc: "For the youth of Seychelles, who are our future and who form a great base of support, we are in need of a strong foundation to cultivate knowledge and experience with the outside world which the average school cannot provide. For this, we have created the Seychelles Party Youth Organization! With this we will be able to forge a youth dedicated to the development of Socialism and International Revolution! We, the builders of Communism, will make our sons and daughters people who will build and see things far greater than we can ever imagine. To them we intrust this responsibility, so it is our responsibility in turn that they will know how!"
 SEY_the_first_of_many_revolutions: "The First Of Many Revolutions"
 SEY_the_first_of_many_revolutions_desc: "The revolution of Seychelles shall be the first of many revolutions. Our ideals of international Socialism shall strengthen our solidarity with workers and toilers the world over. Revolutionaries across the globe will have our help from our brave volunteers. Let the bourgeoisie tremble with fear! The hordes of revolutionaries will take the world in their hands. Wherever there is a struggle against oppression and slavery, we shall be there!"
 SEY_put_into_practice: "...Put Into Practice"
 SEY_put_into_practice_desc: "The romantic ideas of revolutionary adventurism and solidarity are something to strive for, sure. But we need a coherent strategy here. Uncoordinated pushes and offensives, incoherent stratagems will cause these revolutions to melt away. We need to plan out our actions and segment the role of our army in society."
 SEY_a_new_constitution: "A New Constitution"
 SEY_a_new_constitution_desc: "Even though our aims are above the nation, it would still be wrong to not allow power to the hands of the working masses of Seychelles. Thus, let us formulate a new constitution. In the old days, the constitution of the state of Seychelles was, in theory, separate from the PMCs that dominated it. In practice, they were one and the same, unbounded by any laws or limits. This will not go on. Our armies and volunteers will be part and parcel of the state, yes. But their role and aims and powers will be well defined with input from the masses."
 SEY_a_peoples_democracy: "A People's Democracy"
 SEY_a_peoples_democracy_desc: "A constitution is only the first step. While we as a country must remain committed to global revolution and emancipation from oppression, and while we cannot allow deviation from this path, we must learn to start at home. The people of Seychelles have been clamouring for representation and democracy for so long. Let them have it! They will be able to decide internal politics and policies within the state from here on out. With this, we will have erased the first blotch of oppression from Earth."
 SEY_a_postnational_community: "A Post-National Community"
 SEY_a_postnational_community_desc: "We are not the only people who think the way we do. Many others from across the world agree with our internationalist vision. Intellectuals, volunteers, adventurists and many other souls have come to Seychelles. Clearly, an important step in fostering a community that will leave behind these conceptions of nations, meant only to divide the working classes."
 SEY_undo_anticommunist_ethos: "Undo Anti-Communist Ethos"
 SEY_undo_anticommunist_ethos_desc: "It is regrettable, but not too surprising, that the foundation of Seychelles PMCs was for so long to act as an Anti-Communist springboard for the industrial bourgeoisie of the world to quash revolutions, strikes, insurgencies, wherever they may rise. This way of thinking is still seared into every level of the state. From some commanders, to the regimentation of the PMCs. It does not need to be said that we will not allow that to go on."
 SEY_bottomup_investments: "Bottom-Up Investments"
 SEY_bottomup_investments_desc: "The development of Seychelles due to decades of colonial rule, and then mercenary rule has left this country in a sorry state. As a result, the petite-bourgeoisie along with the proletariat and peasants are a historically progressive force. In order to develop the productive forces of our nation, we will have to give money and investment to the masses of Seychelles. As the economy grows, so will our prosperity. The men and women of Seychelles will finally see just a fraction of the vast wealth they made for their exploiters. And oh! To what heights it will take them!"
 SEY_ending_the_dictatorship: "Ending The Dictatorship"
 SEY_ending_the_dictatorship_desc: "The final stretch of introducing civilian rule involves dealing with the terror and oppressive laws and policies. Impressment and billeting of troops has been rampant throughout this country's history, and has caused much resentment. To end a dictatorship of the soldiers, we shall smite out these laws dreamed up by geriatric fools blinded by money. The terror that ruled over the cities and farms will at last come to an end."
 SEY_a_popular_army: "A Popular Army"
 SEY_a_popular_army_desc: "The Army of Seychelles must no longer be an army of gold and money. It must be an army that serves the people and fights for the people! Not just the people of Seychelles but the people of the whole world. One that will not only act to fight off the invaders, but to develop and aid local communities at home and abroad. To spread the word of Socialism and Communism. This must be our duty if we are to secure the revolution at home!"
 SEY_army_structure_reforms: "Army Structure Reforms"
 SEY_army_structure_reforms_desc: "There are many problems with the old structuring of the army. What we need is to reform this institution in order to make the higher up officers and generals more accountable. To give a bigger say to the rank and file soldiers who do the fighting at the end of the day. In doing so, we will have a nation that trusts its army even more and an army that is able to act as one!"
 SEY_diplomatic_attach_corps: "Diplomatic Attaché Corps"
 SEY_diplomatic_attach_corps_desc: "Cooperation with nations in which we intervene cannot stop and end with military intervention. It is imperative that we form Diplomatic Attaches that will serve as a strong basis to not only form and establish long lasting, friendly relationships with these nations, but also to strengthen the cause of Socialism wherever we are!"
 SEY_civilianpmc_integration: "Civilian-PMC Integration"
 SEY_civilianpmc_integration_desc: "For a while, PMCs in Seychelles were mostly barred from accepting natives and civilians into the armed forces and command structures. But with our new mission and new goals, this is an outdated way of doing things. If we are to encourage the development of Socialism and international revolution, we must ensure that our people who wish to fight for the freedom of the international workers and proletariat are able to do so."

While Barlow plans on making some changes, the boat won’t be rocked too much, despite some groans and complaints from our other potential inheritors. We must remember not just how we got here, but learn from what will keep us here in less than a decade."
 SEY_civilianization_of_government_desc: "The Seychelle’s may be a state defined by its deep rooted connections to soldiers of fortune and those fortunate enough to finance them, but not everyone who lives here carries a gun and rides in a private jet. We must make room for a more conventionally “democratic” method of governance within the Seychelles, especially one that keeps ordinary people in mind. While we aren’t setting up committees of comrades or requiring military service to vote, we are opening the gilded doors of our democracy to a wider audience."
 SEY_a_ceremonial_president_desc: "Simply reforming the structures of power isn’t enough, we must first start with reforming what those who wield power can do. By limiting the presidency to a much more ceremonial role and empowering the legislative elements, we can truly reform the Seychellois government for good."
 SEY_provinces_and_councils_desc: "We should start our process of reform and restructuring by going down to a local level, lifting the barrier of entry and increasing accessibility in municipal administrative areas. Creating a standardized method of government across the island chains that integrates local citizens, private military personnel, and our business allies, will serve to streamline government within cities and townships."
 SEY_adopting_a_constitution_desc: "Constitutions are something expected of a modern state by this point, and the fact that we don’t have one is starting to go from a trivial fact to a large headache. A number of cases and incidents ranging from court trials to corporate scandals have begun to show the dire need we have for a single central binding legal document. But how do we approach it?"
 SEY_civilian_elections_desc: "If we truly want to democratize, then transitioning away from military democracy and corporate oligarchy is necessary, we must open up and empower the citizenry. Granting them greater influence and importance by prioritizing citizenship and the issues that come with it in our government by tieing more important positions to citizen elections will further our process of reforms across the Seychelles."
 SEY_expand_military_democracy_desc: "The Seychelles has been an experiment in a state for soldiers by soldiers, so why doesn’t our governing structure reflect that? We must place greater importance on our military personnel within our electoral process and in governing affairs, be they citizen or non-citizen. By giving our military personnel more relevancy and weight in government, we can expect better performance and morale on their end and better policy making when it comes to us."

He'd been contacting the newest civilian authorities of Victoria to inquire on potentially having the party last all the way to the Witching Hour. It would be an enormous carnival - at least in the Seychellois scale. Three hundred invited and another fifty as staff. Romuald was from a wealthy Franco-Seychellois family and figured it wouldn't be too hard to get authorization.\nHowever, today it seems his plans came to a sudden halt.\n"What the fuck?" - Romuald refreshed the page, checking for any potential corrective e-mails. Nothing.\n\nHe didn't even read most of it - what mattered was that the party could not go on past 11 in the evening. What the hell? He'd been planning this for ages, don't those grunts have anything better to do than do military exercises in the largest city of the country at 1 in the morning?\n\nThere was nothing that could be done. Whilst the Seychellois government and even Vice President had permitted the party to last as long as it was desired to - the military faction of the Seychellois National Assembly vetoed any end to the current curfews for large, civilian gatherings, with exceptions only existing for gatherings under 50 people as a compromise."

No mail of importance entered, only marketing deals and the occasional spam. Erik cursed under his breath, and clicked refresh again. He looked to the top, and read with joyous glee, "Mr. Prince, we are ready. Give us the order" Erik took one final look, smirked, and began to type his response. He only needed 1 word, yet it held 1000s of ounces of value.\n"Proceed"\nHours later, news headlines rocketed through the local broadcasting networks.\n"Erik Prince absorbs major corporations!"\n"Prince annexes majority of Seychellan companies"\n"The New Monopoly: Erik Prince integrates Seychellan Economy"\nErik began to giggle a little. All of his efforts led to here, and now, in the span of what felt like seconds, he had become one of the most powerful men on Earth. 2 shots of bourbon entered his throat, leaving him even more jovial than he was before.\nThe clack of high heels could be heard coming from the hallway. Erik snapped up, cleaned up his looks, fixed his collar, and sat down with his hands folded on the table. The woman opened the door, and in her usual politeness, began to speak.\n"Mr. Prnice, you have your speech in 45 minutes. The venue is already filled to the brim."\nErik looked one final time at his minor office. This room had seen all of his gargantuan achievements, and he looked at his wooden desk he had used ever since he was a boy. However, he had a higher purpose, one he knew had to be fulfilled. With a shotgun of his suit cuffs, he stood, and began to walk towards not only his car, but his future."

Our other strategy involves an elite echelon of silent neo-ninjas, due to the exorbitant equipment and training costs, this class would have to be much fewer in numbers.\n\nCritics of the brawn model argue that our roided-up warriors would spend more time destroying the base and killing their fellow soldiers than engaging the enemy. Advocates cite that their extreme brutality and pain tolerance would make them an unavoidable presence on the battlefield.  Those arguing against the brains model dismiss them as inconsequential due to their small numbers and stealthy nature while those in favour imagine them as invisible ghosts sewing panic and terror in the ranks of the enemy.\nTaking both sides into account, Spicer makes his final judgement:"

After years of grunt work he'd finally got his first solo mission for his PMC - to intercept and eliminate a local CO operating with the BRF. This was his moment, his time to -\nA sound. The rumble of an engine. This was it. Renaud and his mission partner assumed their roles and flagged down the approaching vehicle. This was their man. "Hey!" Renaud called out, "Don't happen to have a toolbox and some spare gas in there, do ya? Our engine's given up." Two men emerged from the car. After a brief exchange, the driver beckoned Renaud to follow him to the back of the truck.\nThe moment came up naturally once they were out of sight. A quick grab to cover the driver's mouth and the slash of a knife, and he was dead. Clean. Renaud gently lowered the body and continued around the vehicle. His partner acted as the distraction, leaving their target with his back exposed. The knife was plunged into his back, severing the spinal cord, dropping the man instantly. A few extra minutes gathering files and intel from their target and the job was finished. A single shot rang out, and they headed back to base."

Second was to simply expand our status as a tax haven which would destroy much of the natural beauty making tourist traps pointless.

He knows full well that if he doesn’t do anything soon, it is likely that Prince could act. Viktor Bout requested the newly-inaugurated Secretary General of the Seychellois People's Democratic Party, James Michel, to lay out some options.\n\nMinutes later Michel hands him three proposals which gave lists and plans for ridding the country of plotters and counter-revolutionaries. The first and foremost logical idea is to purge minor rival Seychellois officers which will lower their influence and strengthen our national stability, Second is to cut down the Three Headed Hydra, the main factions which oppose Bout's revolution and the rest will come down with it. Finally, the third option is to purge most of the current Seychellois high command and fill in the governmental and military gaps with Soviet aid and expatriates.\n\nViktor carefully thought of the people he considered friends.

Born in 1937, Moneta has gone all around the World for a French import-export company, from Gabon to Sierra Leone. However, his heart drifted closest to South Africa, where he resided for several years and had a cushy job as an actor.\n\nHowever, something called for him in the mercenary industry - all the military-themed movies he was in certainly influenced that. His first big breakthrough as a mercenary came as an incredible success - having met Mad Mike Hoare in Durban, South Africa, the two became good friends and eventually were called up together to overthrow the Seychellois socialist government by the CIA and the South African government - with a carte blanche on what to do after that.\n\nOf course, our heroes couldn't pass up such an opportunity.\n\nAs the coup ensued and several more mercs became interested in the venture, a group of about 50 highly skilled mercenaries were brought to the Victoria Airport and surprised the low-security airport with an attack at just the right time, resulting in the takeover of the airport and an assault of the government building. With the socialist René government capitulating, after some key help from Seychellois anti-communists, businessmen, intellectuals and opposition politicians, the mercs set up a "transitional military authority" which would return Seychelles to a democracy. However, this never really happened - the TMA simply became increasingly byzantine and larger in scope, bringing in people from all over the World and Seychellois residents to partake in the fun. Now, Tullio Moneta is an old man. He is tired and has had his fun. He sits in his throne of bullets wearing a crown of knives, and makes the ferries run on time."

Of course, the 5000 locals were still there, but only a few of them spoke comprehensive english. The main language of Fregate Island was, after all, a dialect of Creole.\nHe tipped his summer hat down into his face and tried to get a tiny bit of sleep. It was all in unicine. The waves, the few screeches of the seagulls… Marc's chair slowly rocked back as his legs pushed him away from the wall. His eyes closed and he slipped into a slumber.\nWithout a warning, the fax machine right beside his ear started to work. Perplexed, he woke up with a rock through his body - letting his chair fall over with him on it.\nHe groaned in pain as Steven chuckled in a sleepy tone, a mug of coffee in his hand.\n"We got mail, sheriff!"

After a few seconds of hard thinking, he crumpled it up and threw it at Marc, who was slowly getting up from the ground again.\n"Can't read that shit," Steven simply said and wandered back to his chair in front of the small hut. Marc mumbled something under his breath, grabbed the crumpled up paper and straightened it again. But as he started to read the letter himself, he became just as confused as Steven was. It was written in what looked like a fake Spanish.\n"Al ĉiuj ekzempleroj!\nPost la decido de hieraŭa kunveno sub prezidanto Viktor Bout, la oficiala lingvo de la Respubliko Sejŝeloj nun estos la Esperanto-lingvo difinita en 1887.

Slightly upset that he got woken up for a digital mistake, he threw the letter next to the trash bin. But just as he wanted to go back to his chair, the fax started to work again - finally in a language he could understand.\n"To all units!\nFollowing the decision of yesterday's meeting under President Viktor Bout, the official language of the Republic of Seychelles will now be the Esperanto language defined in 1887.

He had kept his cards close to his chest, not elaborating on why exactly he needed them.\n\nSoon, Bout emerged from the trees, clad in military uniform and flanked by men holding up a banner: ESPERANTISTOJ DE ĈIUJ LANDOJ, UNUIĜU!, it read.

Bout took to the stage in the centre of the tent city and began speaking: "Comrades, fellow Esperantists, young men and women from all over the World, you have been gathered here for the greatest internationalist project the human race has yet seen. Your role in our project cannot be understated. You are the leading vanguard of this revolution and your animating purpose is to spread the great unifying language and the spirit of socialism to the youth of the Seychelles and soon, the entire Earth.

SEY.1.desc: ""Fire!"\n\nThe shout was like a knife tearing the silence to shreds. The sound of gunshots was even louder, causing the colorful parakeets perched on the nearby branches to fly away from the thunderous yell.\nAfter a chamber was fired into the air, in honorable intent, six men began to march slowly, carrying the coffin of Tullio Moneta on their shoulders.They slowly approached the deep hole where the dead commander was supposed to rest in the darkness of the earth.\nThe coffin with Tullio's body soon began to slowly descend into the grave. It was decorated with exotic flowers as well as those that could be found in Italy - the country where he was from -  It was draped with the Seychellois flag and a laurel wreath on top - The symbol worthy of awe-inspiring commanders. As the vista of a sunset came on, a nearby band began sounding a composition of the grand Italian canon: The Legend of Piave, in a slow and more somber key. The vicinity of the grave was filled with a mass of soldiers in the most elegant uniforms. Regiments came together to salute their supreme commander, now in the next World.\nThe flags of various countries fluttered peacefully in the idyllic sea breeze. Representatives from all over the world watched the whole ceremony with interest and respect. Apart from diplomats and soldiers, there were also actors and actresses - close friends of the deceased and his associates.\nThe same mercenaries who brought the coffin approached the grave and together they slid the granite cover over it. Above the grave stood a sculpture depicting a snapshot of Moneta’s life - “An actor, a soldier and a great leader” was carved in its base. Candles and flowers placed, the air dense with smoke and the darkness of a coming night. Some started praying according to their faith. Some, certainly less modest characters had arrived to make speeches and try to win over favors from the grieving men."

SEY.2.t: "I Am Inseparable From The Impossible"
SEY.2.desc: "The calm sea lapped its waves lazily against the shore. It was a quiet night in Fiume - the City of Holocaust. It was the birthplace of Tullio Moneta. It's been a long time since Moneta could visit his hometown. Now the time has come for the famous actor and brave mercenary to rest in an eternal sleep among his ancestors.\nIt wasn't easy to move his body from Africa back to Europe. Unwelcome eyes and travel complications could easily defile the former leader's funeral rites. His comrades and friends wanted his body to taste the soil of his homeland. Therefore, they devised a perfect plan to accomplish this impossible mission.\nAround the first o'clock, a boat arrived in a hidden cove near the cemetery with the mercenary's coffin. Quickly, the ship's crew hauled the casket to a funeral car parked by the shore. The chauffeur nodded his readiness to depart. He pressed the accelerator and started the car in motion. Mercenaries slowly approached the cemetery. They had to make sure the place was safe first before they could join the rites. A few of them stood to watch. Others entered the parish office to ensure that the bribed priest had kept his end of the bargain. And the rest, carrying shovels, began to look for a fixed place for the grave.\n\nApart from them, there was not a living soul in the cemetery. Only a few colorful candles were still smoldering joyfully, lighting the cemetery flowers. Once they were sure that nothing threatened the peace of their leader, they could get to work. Mercenaries with shovels began digging the grave. After several dozen minutes of painstaking work, the resting place was finally ready. It was not the most elegant grave. A modest cross and only earth to cover the body. But they couldn't afford anything louder for fear that someone would want to desecrate Tullio's body in search of revenge.The chauffeur finally arrived, and everyone gathered to lift the coffin out of the car. The problem was lowering the coffin into the grave. With the help of ropes, the coffin descended to the bottom of the pit. It took a while to fill the hole, but that was the easiest part of the job. Everyone gathered after work stood over the grave in silence. After reflection, everyone saluted, closing a specific chapter in their lives in which they fought alongside Moneta. The mercenaries and the chauffeur began to gather towards the exit. However, one of them spotted a last bug that needed to be fixed.\n\n"Wait!"\n\nHe found a small plaque near one of the graves and scribbled the sentence.\n"Here lies Tullio Moneta - 1937-2021 - Great Leader and Great Warrior"\nMoneta could not just rest in a nameless grave, condemned to eternal oblivion..."

With time, the Italians of Eritrea became Eritreans, and now we are an Italian-speaking oddity in Africa - yet, a proud one.

All major stations in his life were connected by a red thread. From Istria to Umbria to Senegal, Gabon, the Kongo and South Africa - and finally the Seychelles. He sighed and his old eyes wandered to the three men sitting on the other side of the table.\n\n"What do you want? Do you just… want to sit there or is there something I can help you young signores with?", the old mercenary asked and smiled a bit.\n\n"See, Tullio - it hurts us to see you this way. All you do now is sit around and sign papers. When was the last time you shot a gun? A good old revolver? A modern rifle? We can see the longing for action in your eyes."\nTullio's eyebrow lifted.\n\n"In a few days, one of our troops will fly to South Africa and fight against the black insurgents in the south east - and they still need a commander."\n\nThe man in the middle opened his holster and pulled out his pistol - offering the handle to Moneta.\n"One last time, old man?""

SEY.4.desc: "Viktor Bout has recently requested funds from the General Assembly to create the first Esperanto-language primary school in Africa. This request has been met with confusion and straight-up denial from other ruling factions, primarly due to the high cost needed to hire Esperanto speaking teachers. Erik Prince completely stood against the idea of focusing on education, wanting to maintain or slightly expand the budget given to the PMCs. Others took a more moderate approach, such as Tim Spicer; who pitched a University over a primary school, citing the un-needed presence of such a school for young children on the islands. Eeben Barlow then proposed sending the money to a normal school, after a long string of debate with other officals. As of now, the General Assembly remains in heated discussion and debate- where anything is possible."
SEY.4.a: "This is a great idea."

The organization, named the "Seychellois Popular Front" advocates for expanded rights for native Seychellois, including the creation of a civilian-centric democracy and taxation on PMCs as to ensure income goes towards the lower classes, even if indirectly. The National Assembly was convened on the legality of this organization, and several different voices have come out in terms of what to do."

About 300,000 US dollars have already gone towards his bank account, which was pre-emptively seized by the local PMC unit before intervention by the National Assembly. As bickering takes place over not only the scandal but also the way the mayor's funds were seized, a few opinions have emerged from separate factions. What shall be done about this?"

I'd do anything to be part of the wonders of mercenary work, especially due to my difficulties in finding connections outside of my humble district. I request that a PMC, preferably nearby my home, provide me with training so I may join forces and help bolster my nation's influence worldwide, not to mention get some money out of it.\n\nCheers, M.A.""

SEY.8.desc: "A stronger than usual storm took place about two days ago in Mahé, our largest island. Whilst this isn't entirely unprecedented, what caught local officials by surprise is the flooding of nearby property and the loss of some agricultural plots nearby the coast. Whilst this isn't economically disastrous, it doesn't stop from concerning our locals and PMCs situated in the coastal areas.\nIn terms of solutions, Tim Spicer has suggested the creation of a concrete dam system which would hold off potential floods more effectively than any other possible approach we can afford - it wouldn't be cheap, but it would permanently solve the issue.\nViktor Bout has proposed an alternative, but effective solution of purchasing sand from nearby Arab countries and using them to bolster Seychellois beaches.\nEeben Barlow has proposed an even cheaper solution as an alternative; simply build watchtowers which will warn locals of potential irregularities and meteorological dangers. Erik Prince, as stern as ever, stated that the only reforms needed are to put military bases further away from the coast. What shall be done?"

SEY.9.desc: "Piracy and violence has taken an uptick in the past few years near the Arabian Peninsula and the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. Whilst this has largely been met with aloofness by our PMCs, the shell civilian parliament alongside many petitioning locals in the National Assembly have reported multiple raids against civilian and merchant ships coming from or coming out of Seychelles, proposing the creation of a small navy with PMC funds to ensure the safety of local merchants. After many months of nagging, the PMCs have agreed to discuss the issue and find a solution. Viktor Bout has proposed the creation of a full navy, fitted with real ships that can protect merchant ships in the more dangerous areas of the Ocean. Spicer has proposed a novel concept of using spare military drones to protect Seychellois merchant ships, which would be remotely controlled by locals. Eeben Barlow has proposed hiring temporary mercenary vessels until the issue subsides, and Erik Prince has not made a statement on the issue."

The primary sectors of interest are mainly in intelligence and propaganda, alongside generalised ways of influencing moment to moment combat in our favour. But one that has become of some interest to the Seychelles elite is that of genetic engineering and modification, even if talks of supersoldiers often causes eyes to roll, there are immediate applications for recently developed forms of biotechnology and even gene therapy that we need to get a hold on."
 SEY_redefining_the_workplace_desc: "We can’t be a nation driven by tomorrow if our offices look like they're stuck in 2001, we need to hold sessions with major financial and industry leaders within Seychelles and encourage dynamic redesigns of the average 9 to 5 across the country.

Handshakes and meetings with Lockheed Martin, Apple, and a number of other industries will open up the Seychelles as a playground for the businessmen of the world.

 SEY_genetic_control_desc: "Ever since the breakthroughs in genetic research thanks to the back to back mapping of the human genome and the discovery of CRISPR-Cas9, the supersoldier projects of the 40s and 50s have been vindicated. We can look into short-term gene therapy projects to improve the well-being and survivability of our mercenaries, encouraging them to push themselves to their limits to acquire on the job data for future research.

 SEY_networking_global_tech_hubs_desc: "Social Media is the future! Some of the richest and quickest growing companies of our day are those who invest in the internet. Perhaps the Seychelles could turn herself into a strong base for up and coming tech companies,maybe even rivalling the former heights of Silicon Valley? We should lax our regulation on social media companies with regards to “privacy concerns” and “data mining”, which can work towards gaining the interest of venture capitalists and angel investors domestically and abroad. The more tech nomads we turn into tech settlers, the better."

But these are all just roadblocks in the way of progress, we can easily pass through them, legally or extralegally. We have to ensure that the vision for the Seychelles remains clear and clean, even if we have to get our hands dirty doing so. Then again, what’s the purpose of a nation of mercenaries if you never get to use them?"
 SEY_110_productivity_desc: "The future isn’t that far off, and time moves by fast. So why don’t our production chains? We need to reinvigorate our domestic developers, trim the fat and keep the muscle. Maybe we should start with replacing some of that muscle all together, automated workers don’t break a sweat or go on strike, placing them into key sectors like manufacturing or logistics could help speed things up and remove some busy work for the rest of us. Which can help free up time for our more creative types and visionary individuals to look into sectors that can give us an edge against the competition. We can also bring in foreign consultants from Japan to help us clean things up on the civic side, replacing the pencil pushers and bean counters of our government with more efficient and intelligent software and algorithms."
 SEY_usher_in_the_age_of_control_desc: "The number one enemy of any combative, from a top-level strategist to a lowly grunt, has always been unpredictability, not simply the unknown but rather the inability to have a situation and/or engagement play out entirely in your favour. Those days are over, and the Seychelles is no longer the victim of fate, we have not only taken fate into our own hands, but instead given it to a labyrinthian network of machines and algorithms designed by our own hands. The Seychelles has become the forerunner in the end of the Age of Information and the start of a much more visionary and efficient era."
 SEY_battlefield_control_desc: "Everyone nowadays has drones, but no one really “uses” drones. We can begun a large scale manufacturing operation of combat and surveillance drones towards not just immediate analysis of hostiles and their movements, but of the entire battlefield itself through a greater analysis of terrain, an overview of supply lines and their contents, and even employing facial recognition software to monitor the morale of enemy combatants and our own. Alongside surveillance drones, we can begin to increase the scale of combative robots as well, linking up contacts with former American, western European and Japanese firms to develop specialised and generalised machinery for both offensive, defensive, and support roles. Granted, this may end up costing the actual jobs of less effective mercenaries down the line, but those who remain will get to reap the rewards even further."
 SEY_utilising_our_impact_desc: "The reforms we’ve implemented were only just the beginning, the Seychelles has not yet fully reaped the benefits of our intensive modernization and digital transformation. We must fully utilise the additional funds, personnel, equipment, and time given to us by these restructurings to prepare for much larger and much more grandiose efforts and projects across the nation. It’s time we take our efforts out of the realm of theory and the short-term and into reality and the long-term applications and methods."
 SEY_new_synergistic_approaches_desc: "Our foreign diplomacy cannot simply be defined by petty ideological concerns or morality, but by current trends and capital flow, we must look towards the two largest likeminded powers for support and sympathy. The European Union is increasingly growing more tight-knit than ever, and with that expansion in western european interconnectedness comes heaps of benefits for us, from additional manpower to additional assets to introduce across the Seychelles and to hand out towards our corporate partners. But the Europeans aren’t our only potential foreign friend, we can also consider the might and potential found within Japan. The technology and methodology found across the Japanese sphere within the Pacific is something we must not only replicate, but admire and learn from, with our own charm applied to it obviously. With the best of the Occident and Orient potentially at our disposal, we will be at the top of our game for years to come."

Despite the United Kingdom no longer being the centre of the European world, let alone the leader of the European Union, it is still a crucial cornerstone to the pan-european project, and all the business interests that come along with it. We must reach out and further our connections to British investors, and specifically, British tech companies. If we want to fully modernise and improve the capacities and equipment of our corporate allies, the British have the means to do so for a cheaper cost."
 SEY_where_the_sun_always_rises_desc: "East Asia has always been a goldmine for western capital, especially for those seeking to control sectors of the economy involving technology. As Japan attempts to secure the continuation of its empire into the 2020s, and as we attempt to ensure Seychelles is taking advantage of the times, we should work with the Japanese as much as possible. Inviting Japanese business consultants to maximise the efficiency of our corporate associates and further implement the relevant designs and mindsets behind the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be extremely useful to us."
 SEY_brushing_up_to_brussels_desc: "Of course, we aren’t simply looking for new sources of revenue and shiny toys, we are also looking for friends in high places. And what better than the de facto capital of the European Union itself? If we can establish for ourselves connections and ties to the European Union and its sphere of influence, we can heavily benefit from a wider base of new customers and clientele. Considering the increasing instability facing regions of the European Union, the wide range of solutions that our services offer will seem more appealing. Especially since with the advances we’ve made in modernising our equipment and personnel, we can even offload or do consulting work for the militaries and police forces of the various European states."
 SEY_unpacking_in_apac_desc: "It is of utmost importance that we expand our ties in the Orient beyond Japan.

In case things worsen for them in Italy, or if Iberia implodes, or if the Irish and British have at it again, we should make ourselves known as a useful force for the francosphere and its various follies."
 SEY_downstream_foundations_desc: "Though our peaks rise to dizzying heights, our core remains remarkably unstable and susceptible to covert attacks. We will provide a better lot for the natives and our fellow soldiers, convincing them that we, and we alone, are the best possible rulers of the archipelago."
 SEY_project_blue_flame_desc: "The United States of America is in utter chaos, which is somewhat good news for us, as it gives us a chance to work with former American allies and affiliates abroad to fill in gaps the land of liberty once did. And for the american front, the state of california under Curtis Yarvin and his roundtable is a nation of fellow futurists like us, out of shared principle we should support their effort in this conflict. We also should do our best to keep the Soviets out of Alaska as well..."
 SEY_project_green_harvest_desc: "The decolonization and liberation of Africa has not yet finished. And our role in it should be one of mutually beneficial gain, they gain stability and independence and we gain a lot of money and combat experience. As another conflict flares up between Biafra and Nigeria, and as South Africa falls apart, we should do our best to aid our allies in nation-building. Besides, there is a lot to be gained from helping to bring of new way of life towards regions in need of repair."
 SEY_upstream_profits_desc: "The archipelago and its day to day affairs shouldn’t be holding us down, we can let the maintenance and governance of it be the concern of small business owners and other locals of importance. We need to aim high and work with leaders of industry and finance to secure the Seychelles role in this new and rapidly changing world."
 SEY_getting_on_the_grid_desc: "For a nation that has done everything to attract high tech corporations, having your electrical grid be in a state of disrepair should have been a major concern. And now it is, we must carry out a plan to modernise and standardise the electrical grid through a joint public-private venture across the island. Perhaps taxing or even licensing those cryptocurrency miners could help ease its improvement as well…"
 SEY_rewritten_contracts_desc: "Not all of our corporation partnerships have been the most "mutually beneficial" for our native and less fortunate inhabitants, and this may become a large problem should it continue. If we take some inspiration from more regulatory models of business, we can rework our agreements to not only benefit the local population but our benefactors as well. Setting up provisions for corporations to set aside funds for local projects such as providing high-end computers in public schools or subsidising free internet, will appease the local population and help our corporate allies in the long-term."
 SEY_revitalised_towns_desc: "Repairing and replacing old buildings is one thing, but actually restoring and redeveloping entire towns is another. With help from small business owners and the emerging professional managerial class, we can promote and uplift local businesses and communities through grants and tax cuts alongside a promotional campaign to attract tourists and corporate leaders to appreciate and experience our “local customs”."
 SEY_raising_the_roof_desc: "When you leave the financial districts and training grounds of our major cities, the contrast between them and our population centres is noticeable, even our non-native population has placed complaints. With the amount of capital flowing throughout the Seychelles, we can easily implement a plan to redesign and rebuild the older and more dilapidated buildings across the Seychelles."
 SEY_billionaires_and_casinos_desc: "Even mercenaries take vacation days, and what better way to accommodate them and our new wealthy benefactors than further developing our entertainment and service industries? If we make the Seychelles a tourist destination that seems more appealing to people in boating shoes and polo shirts instead of people in jackboots and kevlar vests, we can benefit from the cash and networking they bring with them. Besides, very few places on earth offer such serene locations and legalised gambling at the same time!"
 SEY_blockchain_and_credibility_desc: "Cryptocurrency has been of great use as of late to the Seychelles, yet it’s full potential, alongside the blockchain, has yet to be utilised.  Aside from encouraging and normalising the use of cryptocurrencies within the Seychelles, we should also greatly consider setting up our own national cryptocurrency to leverage ourselves in the market and influence it even further. We can also fund research initiatives to expand and fully implement blockchain-based technologies in public and private sectors to activate new streams of revenue and increase security, even in non-digital ventures. And we can frame it as a method of “democratisation” to make it more publicly appealing as well."
 SEY_companies_and_brands_desc: "A number of major corporations, following the collapse of the United States of America, have begun large scale relocation projects for their main corporate offices. And the Seychelles must present it as the best candidate among their options. We can field a large public relations and advertising campaign to inform them of the various benefits of relocating to our archipelago, especially for ones relating towards technology."
 SEY_cognisance_and_boundaries_desc: "It is not enough for us to simply be the best choice for these corporations to partner and operate with, we must be the most professional and accommodating choice as well. To ensure this, we will begin to encourage doctrines of professionalism among our various avenues of corporate diplomacy to gain their full trust and support as to avoid any complications and hesitation on their behalf."
 SEY_an_archipelago_united_desc: "The Seychelles is no longer the same nation it was a decade ago. Our pursuit of the future has not left us blind of our present conditions. We have done our best to bring the future to everyone, be they soldier, secretary, shopkeep, or stock broker. Our archipelago is united no longer by guns and boats, but computers and compassion, uplifting colonial towns and villages into digital communities rivalling the heights of Tokyo or Moscow. As we charge into the unknown future, we at least know we have left no one behind."
 SEY_the_silicon_archipelago_desc: "The Seychelles is no longer the same nation it was decades ago. We are now a forward thinking nation built upon the backs of visionary entrepreneurs and the soldiers willing to fight for their vision. Our citizens live on the edge of tomorrow, with our archipelago no longer  simply unified by boats or guns, but by data and drones serving them beyond just the battlefield. As the world of tomorrow approaches every so slightly, we have taken the first steps into embracing its warmth."

 SEY_laying_the_brickwork_desc: "The inaugural project of our new infrastructure effort will concern a massive infrastructure boost. We shall build new roads through Mahé’s hills and purchase new civilian boats to provide a consistent link to the outlying islands. This will result in a long-sought improvement to business efficiency and the living standards of the natives, driving them closer to the warm embrace of the future."
 SEY_seychelles_20_desc: "We now stand as a nation linked by more than culture or heritage, or some other material bond. We now stand as a nation linked by our leap into the future, our victory over the unknown and the uncertain will be recorded in the blockchains and internet archives for years to come."

Commander Prince sends his regards.” YOU LITTLE SHIT!” Lucas roared as he drew his pistol, shooting the mansion guard in the head and taking off into the mansion, firing more shots behind him as he sprinted off. “Spread out and find him!” Heard barked, taking cover and returning fire at Lucas. “I want him dead or in handcuffs at my feet, and don’t let him get away!” “As for the rest of them...” Heard turned to his lieutenant, a sick grin showing through his face mask as he listened to the begging and tears of Lucas’ Legal team..."
