WNE.18.t: "Second Toyota War [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.18.desc:0 "As the First Toyota War, Gaddafi's gamble against the French, ended in French victory, Libya has licked its wounds and waited for the right time to strike once more and bring the exiled FROLINAT government in Tripoli to N'Djamena. Reports from N'Djamena have confirmed that Libyan and FROLINAT exiles have crossed into French territory, resulting in an immediate declaration of war on Libya and the FROLINAT forces by the French government, backed by the EU and NATO. The ensuing war has found use once more of several types of pickups, way past the Toyotas of the 80s, but regardless still just as bloody, confusing and destructive as the previous."

WNE.19.t: "Second Toyota War Concludes [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.19.desc:0 "Once the government in Abéché attempted to seize the capital of N'Djamena and ensured the Second Toyota War, it seemed unlikely that France would be able to pull through against an enemy so far away from home. Yet, through thousands of volunteers in Chad and elsewhere in French Africa, not to mention international backing by western nations through food and munitions, France has pulled a humiliating blow against Gaddafi's Libya. Protests across Tripoli and Benghazi have picked up since, demanding justice for the lost men, money, and prestige internationally. What is going to come out of Libya after this however is up for speculation."
WNE.19.a:0 "Gaddafi failed once more."
WNE.20.t: "Second Toyota War Concludes [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.20.desc:0 "Confusing news has come out of N'Djamena where it appears the FROLINAT forces, backed by Libya, have successfully expelled the French from northern Chad, resulting in an embarassing ceasefire where Chad has become split in half by a straight line, creating the first sovereign Chadian nation in history. As the French forces are forced into Ubangi and sent home, Chadians in northern towns celebrate their freedom."

#WNE.27.t: "Idriss Déby Enacts Fair Elections [GetNewsGraphic]"
#WNE.27.desc:0 "Surprising news come out of Central Africa today as Chadian President, Idriss Déby, has peacefully given power to a new government and retired after unifying Chad during the Second Toyota War. Previously expected to simply remain in power as an autocrat, the "maverick" Déby has shown himself to be unpredictable once more. Despite the war hero reputation, Déby has stated in an interview that he wishes to rest easy after such an intense period of his life, and that more "capable, young leaders" will come along. Albert Padacké, the President-Elect, is best described politically as a "democratic socialist" and seeks to reconcile Chad's political bases to create a stable democracy with economic justice."
#WNE.27.a:0 "Genuinely surprising!"
#WNE.28.t: "Chadian President Assasinated [GetNewsGraphic]"
#WNE.28.desc:0 "Despite the decisive victory of the Republic of Chad over their Libyan and FROLINAT enemies, it seems the country cannot get any respite. The sitting president, Idriss Déby Itno, has been shot by a suspected FROLINAT rebel that was sitting as a sleeper cell in the capital, N'Djamena, waiting for the right time to strike. Immediately after, Chad's civilian government was dissolved and a "national emergency" was declared, bringing about a military government under Déby's son, Mahmat. All things considered, it seems Chad's peace was fleeting. Thousands of soldiers flock to the northern regions, and very few believe the civil war is over in any capacity..."
#WNE.28.a:0 "Unfortunate."

#these two events were for when Déby ruled an independent chad, JVPITER took him

WNE.29.t: "Marxist-Leninists Coup Chad [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.29.desc:0 "After the FROLINAT victory in Chad's Second Toyota War, it seems the coalition of socialists and anti-French nationalists has collapsed and a new, self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninist government has taken over the fleeting Chadian state. As the dust settles, several governments have recognized the new state, oddly enough giving the Soviets and People's Republic of China some common ground in African interests. Regarding policy, a new flag has been created, meant to illustrate a new beginning for the nascent Marxist-Leninist state. Already, the ruling party, the Chadian Action for Unity and Socialism, has outlawed all rival political organizations and created a one-party state."

WNE.30.t: "Papal Conclave Elects New Pope [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.30.desc:0 "With Pope Benedict XVI's retirement, the Vatican City State and the Holy See convened once more to elect a new Bishop of Rome, the Pope. As the fumata bianca (white smoke) rose through the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, millions of Catholics around the World jubilated, seeing the successful election of a new Pope. The new Pope, Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, a Maronite from Lebanon and a senior Cardinal, has taken the papal name of "Gregorius". The new Pope has expressed views strongly in favor of cooperation between Catholics and Muslims, alongside making several comments hostile to Israel, which worry many. Regardless, the new Pope is well-received in the West, despite being the first non-European pope since the 8th Century."
WNE.30.a:0 "Habemus Papam!"
WNE.31.t: "Papal Conclave Elects New Pope [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.31.desc:0 "With Pope Benedict XVI's retirement, the Vatican City State and the Holy See convened once more to elect a new Bishop of Rome. The new Pope, Jorge Mario Bergoglio is a Jesuit from Argentina, and thus has become the first Pope in history to be from the Americas, the first Jesuit pope, and the first Pope from the Southern Hemisphere. These achievements aside, Bergoglio has taken up the papal name of "Francis". His views are considered very progressive for the Catholic Church, including making the Church more welcoming to LGBTQ people and to further emphasize the Church's role in protecting the poor. Decried as a communist by many traditionalists, Francis is nonetheless celebrated by Latin Americans and poor Catholics as their champion, although some worry about his pro-Soviet views."
WNE.31.a:0 "Habemus Papam?"
WNE.32.t: "Papal Conclave Elects New Pope [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.32.desc:0 "With Pope Benedict XVI's retirement, the Vatican City State and the Holy See convened once more to elect a new Bishop of Rome, the Pope. As the fumata bianca (white smoke) rose through the chimney of the Sistine Chapel, millions of Catholics around the World jubilated, seeing the successful election of a new Pope. The new Pope, Robert Sarah from Guinea (a majority Muslim country) is the first African pope since the 5th century AD, the first black Pope, among several other achievements. These things aside, Robert has taken the papal name of "Martinus" and seeks to maintain a conservative direction for the Catholic Church. Believing in fighting against all radicalizations of the Abrahamic tradition, he is seen by many as a step back in Catholic history."
WNE.32.a:0 "Habemus Papam."

CHD_FLAVOR.1.desc:0 "Grégory was using his notebook near the "African Sorbonne", the Republican University of Africa, looking at memes and responding to some Discord messages. As he finished up his notifications, he looked up from the screen and saw through the window the incoming winds and dust storm. There had been several safeguards towards the health of the lake done over decades, including using the fossilized diatoms in the area to enrich the soil, which created a beacon of green around the Sahara, combating desertification. Grégory saw this marvel of engineering at work and couldn't help but sigh.\n\n"Thankless fucks," he thought out loud of the Islamists and socialists, backed by Libya, to the north. "They'd kill everything good about this place."\n\nThe heat was sweltering and the whole city of Bodéléville felt like an artificial creation kept up by sheer dominance of Man over Nature - and yet, that's what made it so wonderful. A beacon of Humanity's ability to carve the World to its image, creating civilizations, destroying reaction and producing masterpieces.\n\nGrégory picks up a cold bottle of Orangina and takes a big sip. He continues using his computer, particularly in a Discord server called "Macroncord", which was basically an outpost of Macronists within and without France. Of course, the whole system was set up in Minitel servers, which were compatible with American internet.\n"Gotta go, fellas. See you" - he types quickly, closing the notebook, strolling past several doors as he arrives in one of the halls dedicated to History.\nHe sees Laurent, the love of his life, waiting for him - sitting at his desk.\n"You're late." - the pale-surnburnt Metropolitan says, cackling after.\n\nGrégory rolls his eyes and shoos Laurent away from the desk.\n\nThe two, in the time to exchange places, share a peck."
