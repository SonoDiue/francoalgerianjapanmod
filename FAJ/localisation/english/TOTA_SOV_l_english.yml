He's felt a weakness coming onto him, with illnesses rearing their ugly heads and making Urban's ever active brain have more and more dissonance with his weakening body. This didn't stop his energies or make him feel particularly despondent, though, as he maintained his duties, rubberstamped laws, made speeches and much more.\n\nUrban was reading the latest entry of the Trybuna Luda, the official outlet of the Polish United Worker's Party. Of course, Urban wasn't that much of an old fart - he was reading it on his computer. Scrolling through the articles, he looked aside for a second to get some water, preparing to rise from his chair.\n\nSuddenly, the left of his face feels numb and droopy, like he was having...\n\nYeah. A stroke. This was a particularly nasty one, coming from a massive intracerebral hemorrhage he did not notice earlier. Jerzy Urban collapsed to the ground, completely unable to move. He slurred a quick "Go fuck yourself!", surprisingly able to yell out from the other side of his mouth like a ventriloquist. Now, the First Secretary of the Polish United Worker's Party has died, only to be found a day later by concerned officials, slouched over. Who was being cursed, and really, his last words, will not be known to anybody besides Urban."

Yet, he remains endeared by the Soviet public and particularly to several of the factions in the Politburo of a more ecletic nature. Concerned reformists cry out his inauguration, as many feel that the Soviet age of continuous reforms and semi-controlled socialist markets has come to an end.

WNE.53.desc: "Romania's National Communist regime has begun falling apart as non-Romanian ethnicities across the frontier regions of the Carpathian mountains rise up and create polities representing their national identities. The Siebenbürger and Székely Republics have been formed after an incident involving Vadim Tudor, now increasingly unhinged, making comments about "making Romania free of Germano-Soviet racial corruption". These comments resulted in fantastical uproar across Transylvania, resulting in the collapse of several Romanian counties' authority on their land. As the situation devolves, the Soviet Union has made vague statements of condemnation. The Hungarian People's Republic, however, has made harsh statements against the Romanian regime, accusing it of breaking from Communism entirely and simply re-creating the Legionary Fascist state of old."

Now, a Soviet-friendly regime has been placed in Bucharest and the Székler People's Republic dissolved, forming into a transitional Soviet Military-Civilian Administration Of Székelyland. This administration has the purpose of "Establishing order in the region" and "mediating conflicts with all parties". In addition, a corridor going from Hungary to Székelyland has been created and directly occupied by Moscow, as a way to ensure safe passage from Hungary to the region in case of necessity."

This was successful after the Siebenbürger and Székler Republics proved hardier than previously expected, and the two polities have become officially neutral and sovereign, gaining recognition by the Warsaw Pact. The two have also received reparations from Romania to rebuild, and free passage from Hungary to Romania and to the two Republics has been made possible with Soviet mediation.

Romania, despite the condemnations and sanctions, has found peace once more - at least for the ones that didn't get to see the war.

SOV.2.t: "What Would Lenin Think"
SOV.2.desc: "Pavel Grudinin was anxious. He paced around the room and sometimes sat, rubbing his temple as hair falls off. The Soviet Union's rowdiest and most uncontrolled neighbor - even more than Finland - Romania, had invaded two self-declared independent Marxist-Leninist republics. Whilst Romania was also a self-declared Marxist-Leninist state, it had turned to its own revisionist doctrine - that of "National Communism". This doctrine, which not only reminds weary Europeans of Hitlerian National Socialism, but also shows a chauvinist character to Romania's government. Yet, would it be the right course of action to invade a sovereign nation in front of everyone - simply because we disagree with their internal affairs? What kind of precedent is that going to set?\n\n Grudinin's desk was now slightly covered in dandruff and silver hair.\n\n"Gross," Grudinin thought.\n\nThis made it pretty clear he had been worrying over this for far too long. It was time to start looking for solutions, and messing his desk wasn't one of them.\n\n"What would Lenin think?", Grudinin thought to himself, his hands interlocking against his mouth."

POLITICS_VADIM_TUDOR_DESC: "Corneliu Vadim Tudor, commonly called by his nickname ‘The Tribune’, is the Prime Minister of Romania and thus the second most powerful man in the country de jure. De facto, Vadim Tudor already yields more influence across the nation than his supposed superior the president. From humble beginnings as a journalist and party-approved poet, he first rose to prominence in the 1990s as the mouthpiece of government magazine ‘România Mare’, a pilot program meant to popularise the Party’s increasing emphasis on nationalism. The next step for Vadim came when Nicolae Ceaușescu and his designated heir Nicu both died in quick succession at the turn of the century, leaving disinterested and awkward Valentin Ceaușescu to fill the position of President of the Republic built by his father.\nIn the malaise of the early Valentin years, Vadim seized the opportunity and established for himself a wide network of connections within the Party and bureaucracy, while constantly cultivating his popularity via the ‘România Mare’ initiative, which grew from a propped magazine to a whole cultural phenomenon by the 2000s. Today, riding this wave of popularity, the Tribune is a man with a plan, and the power to make his plan reality: he is fiercely critical of the entrenched political establishment, calling for the total ‘dismemberment of crypto-bourgeois bureaucracy’; he is an open supporter of ethnic supremacy, calling the Romanians to be wary of ‘alien elements within their midst’ and dismantling the last vestiges of minority rights; he is a champion of ‘total national sovereignty’, constantly critiquing the WTO and the ‘Soviet International Order’. For Vadim Tudor, all these make up his program of a new Cultural Revolution, a sweeping transformation of Romania to rival that of Ceaușescu himself."
