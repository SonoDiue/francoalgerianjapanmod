AST_electoral_maj: "Electoral Majority Amendment"
AST_electoral_maj_desc: "Proposed in 1973 by then-controversial Prime Minister Jack Lang, and often referred to as the “Lang Will”, in an attempt to secure a more resounding and guaranteed victory of the Australian Labor Party, this constitutional amendment guarantees whichever party obtains a plurality of at least 30% or more of the total vote in an election, receives 50% of the seats in the upper and lower house of the Australian parliament."
AST_pine_gap: "The Pine Gap Handshake"
AST_pine_gap_desc: "During the late 1960s to early 1970s, foreign powers and the Australian government quietly and secretly came to an agreement on how to approach and handle a global rise in anti-social, problematic, and unproductive behavior. By strategically and purposefully underfunding and ill-equipping law enforcement and intelligence services, which has unintentionally begun to foster specific ideological leanings and criminal tendencies among them, the world has chosen Australia once again as its dumping ground for the socially misaligned and the economically unviable."
AST_megaprojs_australiana: "Megaprojects and Australiana"
AST_megaprojs_australiana_desc: "When one visits Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, they are often completely unaware that they are witnessing Australia’s two defining characteristics on the world stage. The first is most obvious thanks to the lake itself. Australia can now boast a rich history of visionary engineers, architects, scientists, and civil planners who, through decades of carrying out enormous terraforming projects, have thus achieved world renown for their skills and insight. The second is far more subtle but can be found all over, from every corner store, billboard, or tour guide. The kitsch and tacky cultural exports that defined Australia long before the lake existed are what is most likely to define Australia in the eyes of the world’s general population."
AST_ghost_white_australia: "The Ghost of White Australia"
AST_ghost_white_australia_desc: "Since the late 1970s,the Australian government has done everything it can to dismantle and distance itself from the racist policies of “White Australia”. Yet a haunting specter still remains. As older segments of the Australian government simply act as if the policy and its cultural legacy never ended, and as the widespread displacement of aboriginals and large scale incarceration rate of ethnic minorities have shown, the wider society still feels its lingering effects to this day."
AST_belle_southern_ball: "The Belle of the Southern Ball"
AST_belle_southern_ball_desc: "Australia has historically never truly fit into one geopolitical camp, and in the 21st century, it still hasn’t. As Japanese and Soviet business interests cast a looming shadow over the Australian public, and indirectly play roles in day to day Australian politics, Western interests struggle to stay relevant, though European and American influence in the region has not entirely waned. Unless global or domestic affairs change greatly, Australia will remain approached by several promising bachelors, and will be beholden to none."
NZL_iwis_kiwis: "The Iwis and the Kiwis"
NZL_iwis_kiwis_desc: "Despite what many would have expected when Winston Peters assumed the highest office in all of New Zealand, the historic and deeply important relationship between the native population and the culture they represent has actually flourished under his tenure. With a wave of “Maorimania” spreading even outside of New Zealand, Polynesian cultural exports and customs are finding popularity in unexpected places both around the Pacific nations, but also, most surprisingly, outside of them too."
NZL_our_fav_uncle: "Our Favourite Uncle"
NZL_our_fav_uncle_desc: "In recent years, our most favorable ally in the world stage has become none other than the United States of America. Following a gradual distancing from our Australian neighbors, especially after the “Hakagate” incident at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, the United States has become a major partner in both free trade and military cooperation for our nation."
NZL_new_new_zealand_military: "A New New Zealand Military"
NZL_new_new_zealand_military_desc: "Ever since our breakaway from Australia in matters of defense, our military suffered a massive decline in its capabilities and overall competence. However, under the Peters administration, we have begun to see a rather unexpected and completely independent revival of our armed and naval forces. This in turn has become a surprising source of national pride in recent years."
PGN_country_that_wasnt: "The Country That Wasn't"
PGN_country_that_wasnt_desc: "Right as the Papuans were granted their independence, the rug was pulled right from under them. Fearing a supposed "imminent communist takeover", a coalition of Australian- and Japanese-aligned NGOs, business groups, and their respective national intelligence agencies made a move to usurp the newly-elected post-colonial government with one that would be more amenable to their interests. This usurpation remains in power to this day."
PGN_tied_tongues_boiled_frogs: "Tied Tongues and Boiled Frogs"
PGN_tied_tongues_boiled_frogs_desc: "To say the Commonwealth of Papua is a culturally and linguistically diverse country would be a grave understatement. With over 1000 recorded languages scattered across a variety of tribes and foreign settlers, the diversity of Papua is often championed and celebrated by its own populace and international observers. Yet, thanks to the severely limited infrastructure present even in major cities, inter-tribal affairs bleeding into everyday occurrences from politics to sports matches, and even the odd report of cannibalism occasionally making the rounds on tabloids and social media, Papua’s central government finds itself suffocating under its own weight."
PGN_port_in_a_storm: "A Port In A Storm"
PGN_port_in_a_storm_desc: "Papua is an incredibly resource-rich nation neighbored by another desperate for those valuables, and, as a result, our foreign overseers have considered themselves the rightful owners of a large chunk of our national resources. Australian and Japanese corporations continue to create one-sided, parasitic contracts with the government, and our people see less and less of that natural wealth ending up in their own hands. Both our people and the government grow more concerned as these leeches end up fatter and fatter at our expense."
australian_mission: "Australian Mission"
australian_mission_desc: "With the backing of the Australian government, a number of christian denominations - from the Catholic and United churches to even some Evangelical churches - organized to begin a supposedly secular charity mission operating in Australia's neighbors. In reality, it has become, and according to some, always was, a socio-economic pressure group intended to manipulate shared cultural values to ensure the receiving nations remain favorable towards Australia. It has had varying degrees of success."
