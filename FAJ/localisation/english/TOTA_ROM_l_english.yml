ROM_ceasca_haunting:0 "The Haunting of Casa Poporului"
ROM_ceasca_haunting_desc:0 "Popular democracies are generally led by the Party, in its collective guiding wisdom. Rarely, firebrand personalities like Lenin arise to further the movement decades in the span of weeks. However, arguably no socialist nation has been so categorically shaped by the total rule of one man as Romania has. There is a ghost haunting Casa Poporului, whose name still commands respect and subservience even in the halls of power. That is none other than the Genius of the Carpathians, Nicolae Ceaușescu. Though his reign might have ended decades ago, Ceaușescu’s legacy continues to define Romania to this day. Countless villages lay razed to the ground on his orders, their inhabitants relocated across the country; entire cities have been remodelled according to his vision, demolishing historic landmarks to make way for socialist realist brutalism and grandeur. On the outskirts of the nation’s new cities, black smog rising from factory complexes dims the light of the sun. In the Party, the enterprises and the ministries, an ossified hierarchy has enabled a constant game of petty influence and corruption. Last but not least, even two decades after his death, people and state alike pay official homage to their First President of the Republic.\nNicolae Ceaușescu has changed Romania definitively and irrevocably - for better, or for worse."
ROM_home_of_national_communism:0 "Home of National Communism"
ROM_home_of_national_communism_desc:0 "While the term “National Communism” has not been officially adopted by the regime, the name has become a common description of Romania’s idiosyncratic system of government among scholars. Romania is a country riddled with paradoxes, from “communism without internationalism” and the ultranationalist, ethnocentric rhetoric employed by the regime to the state-backed status of the Orthodox Church and the championing of international peace juxtaposed over Romanian society’s ultra-militarisation.\nRomania’s standing as a regional power in the Balkans, the leader of an emerging informal “National Communist Bloc” within the socialist world and the country’s self-proclaimed “international prestige” have made Romanian scholars and ideologues egotistically call their republic the “Fourth World Power”. Absurd though it may be, there is some truth to such a statement: Romania, a bridge between the Eastern and Western Worlds and one of the leaders of the Third World, has often stood as a neutral ground for opposing forces on the world stage to negotiate on."

ROM_shitty_industry:0 "Bloated Heavy Industry"
ROM_shitty_industry_desc:0 "At every party congress, the numbers presented tell of the constant and massive expansion of Romanian industry, unrivalled by any other nation on the globe. The situation on the ground, however, tells an entire different story: a story of greatly inflated numbers and of a stagnant economy. Romania’s rapid industrialisation under Nicolae Ceaușescu has resulted in a bloated, under-specialised and expensive to maintain heavy industry. Light industry is barely existent, and decades of economic mismanagement and the harsh austerity of the 80’s have resulted in many Romanian households lacking many important consumer goods, and luxuries are almost non-existent. You cannot nurture a people with coal, nor can you feed them steel - and the continued economic hardship endured by the Romanian populace may one day blow up in the government’s face."
ROM_national_revolution:0 "The Second Romanian Cultural Revolution"
ROM_national_revolution_desc:0 "Vadim Tudor’s increasingly radical rhetoric, deemed ‘cryptofascist’ by his opponents, is, in many ways, a mere continuation of the course Romanian history was already on well before Vadim’s rise to power. From Gheorghiu-Dej to Nicolae Ceaușescu, Romanian society saw an ever-growing nationalist sentiment, culminating in the ‘July Theses’ of 1971, which signalled the start of a mini-cultural revolution within Romanian society. Unlike in 1971, however, the new cultural revolution seeks to dismantle the supposedly bourgeois state apparatus, barely disguised in the form of self-interested bureaucrats, ‘allogeneous elements’ and unproductive members of society, all encouraged by ‘corrupt foreign influences’. The end goal of Vadim’s ‘revolution’ is stripping the state to its barest essentials. Whether this comes out of genuine ideological conviction or is merely an attempt by the control freak that is Vadim Tudor to centralise all power around himself, as his critics indicate based on his rising cult of personality, remains to be seen. Valentin Ceaușescu, reduced to a mere puppet-president of Vadim Tudor and his ultranationalist clique, has thus far been silent on the subject of the various policies implemented by Vadim."
ROM_black_sheep:0 "Black Sheep of the Warsaw Pact"
ROM_black_sheep_desc:0 "The seemingly never-ending list of irredentist claims pursued by the Romanian regime and the obsession with national independence has, to no one’s surprise, caused countless conflicts within the Warsaw Pact. In Transylvania, a mini-cold war is waged, not with guns and bullets, but rather with ideologically-charged ‘history books’ and scholarly papers, while an endless stream of speeches loudly proclaiming Bessarabia to be Romanian has caused an uproar among the leaders of the organisation. The culmination of these inter-Pact conflicts was Romania’s refusal to allow Soviet troops into Czechoslovakia during the Prague Spring, Ceaușescu’s famous condemnation of foreign meddling in the internal affairs of Communist Parties remaining forever engraved in Romanian consciousness. Moscow eyes Bucharest with suspicion, and, for all intents and purposes, Romania has been ostracised from the Warsaw Pact, despite its continued presence in the alliance’s economic organisations."
