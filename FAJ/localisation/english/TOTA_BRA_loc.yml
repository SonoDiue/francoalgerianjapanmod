BRA.1.t: "Tempo No Tempo"
BRA.1.d: ""It isn't typical for Brazil's military junta to have a President in power for longer than 5 years. In fact, it never happened before. However, as much as terms cycle and new Presidents are brought in, the political elite that snuffed out the Populist Republic is most definetly reaching some unpleasant ages. After a third governing junta sacked the more reformist-oriented Jarbas Passarinho, Bornhausen was chosen as the ARENA candidate for the 2014 elections as a darling of the Junta's "Center" which rejected reforms among the population and extremism among the lower officers, favoring instead managerial elites which had presided over Brazil's economic miracle, among other achievements.\n\nHaving won practically unopposed, the oldest President in Brazilian history continued the course of managed markets, censorship and bureaucratic managerialism - but now, Bornhausen is on his way out of the Presidency, and ARENA has not yet announced a successor. It's unknown to our sources if this is showing instability in the Alliance or if it's calling for the other factions to agree on a compromise candidate.\n\n-Dan Barry, New York Times"\n\nHenrique picked up a Gatorade and took a sip. Then his eyes drifted towards his coworker in the clean, air conditioned office.\n\n"What do you think?"\n\n"No way.", Pedro replied."
BRA.1.a: "Agreed."
BRA.2.t: "Morning Lemonade"
BRA.2.d: "Marco Maciel, former Vice President and well-respected moderate in the Alliance, was expected to be okay for a 5 year term. He was in relatively fine shape, and he was eager for the job as a last note before retirement.\n\n3 months later, Trevor was working as an intern in the Palácio Da Alvorada, as an aide to the President. He provided drinks and food, alongside providing news to the Head of State. Today, there was a deafening silence in the Palace. He had not been requested even a cup of water since yesterday and now he was obligated to open the door to provide news on a law being passed in Congress that demanded the President's approval.\n\nKnock knock.\n"This isn't working", said Trevor quietly to himself. Picking up an old keychain, he unlocked the door to the President's study.\n\nThere, Marco Maciel was in the ground behind the desk, his leather chair on the ground and a puddle of urine in the ground."
BRA.2.a: "Am I in a fucking retirement home?"
BRA.3.t: "A Great Future Lying Ahead"
BRA.3.desc: "As chaos erupted in the streets, and long-dormant terrorists across the country come out of the woodwork - from parliamentarians to students - it wouldn't be a bad bet to say Brazil is about to collapse into civil war. That is, if it weren't for the fact that the "terrorist cells" also are incredibly disunited in their goals and desires, with the only common thing being the return to civilian rule. Most of the Army remained loyal, but tiny rebellions speckle the Brazilian network of points and bases. As tensions pile up, and the Government began seriously considering surrendering to the insurrectionary forces - Rui Alves Catão brought his case to the table - that if the local divisions in the Planalto Military Command refuse to give up their positions, the entire coalition against the military government will collapse. This is seen as insane by anyone in the controlled opposition, and in the more moderate circles of ARENA. Yet, the whole idea seemed very captivating to try.\n\nWhat shall be done is up to the parliamentarians, whose choice will forever etch the future of the Nation..."
BRA.3.a: "Catão's gamble might just be what we need."
BRA.4.t: "Dice"
BRA.4.desc: "Catão's gamble seemed to work. Refusing to give ground and being petulant towards the revolting units and civilians meant that their bluff began to fall apart. The opposition began splintering and anti-communist militias brutally silenced the countryside, as chaos continues in the streets and anarchy sweeps the Nation outside of the capital. And so, the heart of Brazil, the planned modernist city of Brasília began marching into the rest of the country with boots stomping on people and tanks riding over the asphalt.\n\nSkulls cracked as Mourão continued his incredible journey throughout the country's pacification. Thousands died, and not a single soul would complain."
BRA.4.a: "They will be forgotten - for ever."
BRA.5.t: "Império"
BRA.5.desc: ""And so, without further deliberations, I nominate Olavo Luiz Pimentel de Carvalho as the new leader of the Alliance for National Renewal."\n\nThis ending communique in the latest session of the Chamber of Deputies left most politicians and junta bureaucrats in utter shock. The quiet, ancient intellectual that had been espousing strange esoteric views for the past couple of decades had finally cracked into the reins of power. Through money, charisma and philosophical prowess, the enfant terrible of the bureaucracy and the Junta's greatest propagandist had become its master. As hundreds of mayors, bureaucrats, ministers, politicians and senators resigned or threatened declaring the nomination to have been a sham, the Army bedgrudgingly accepts the popular-ish propagandist as a return to tradition, a tradition much more sacred and much more ancient than whatever the Junta cooked up with its nods to Christian moralism.\n\nOlavo de Carvalho himself was in his library, smoking a cigarette as he grinned slightly, a pang hitting his chest of realization and achievement. He'd done it. Candles were put in boxes and he crossed his forehead with holy water."
BRA.5.a: "Alá..."

WNE.57.t: "Olavo de Carvalho's Brazil [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.57.desc: "As a widely disputed and legally dubious nomination set the stage after turmoil in Brazil's political scene, it is not surprising that Brazil's newest President is more on the extreme right, as many saw a need for a "heavy hand" against traitors to the country. What did shock many however was just how extreme he would be. Olavo de Carvalho was known as an important propagandist to the Brazilian junta and was known to hold esoteric views on astrology, Islam, Christianity and more, but ommitted them often in public, only mentioning them in smaller religious papers and essays. Nonetheless, his erratic and strange policies have been causing chaos in Brazil's more liberal cities and total confusion in its remote towns, all responded to with unspeakable brutality. Among the most affected are the Afro-Brazilians, whom've had all statues of animist and traditional African deities destroyed, their languages crushed and their culture and lives crushed."
WNE.57.a: "A quack with an army."
