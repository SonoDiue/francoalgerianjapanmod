JAP_diplomatic_problems_desc:0 "Our Empire is one that's relatively insular in a world of very liberal democracy, or worse, left-wing economic populism. We find ourselves having carved our great Sphere, fallen far from its lofty ambitions. Even then, our detractors, the United States, have consistently demanded we concede even further, despite having already given so much. Despite our détentes with the West, we still find ourselves lacking in friends at the international scale."

We've succeeded in becoming one of the prime global superpowers, even despite the humiliating peace in 1944 after our great gambit. China finds itself on fire through uncompromising communism, Korea is our ally, and several other areas with economic potential find themselves within either our Sphere or in poverty. Thus, as heirs to East Asia, our economy continues to grow, despite the middling rates."

JAP_kokutai_undamaged_desc:0 "Our national divinity, not only of the Yamato people of course but also of the Emperor and his family, has not been once damaged or humiliated by a foreign power. Japan has been able to maintain complete and total sovereignity in terms of cultural, national and spiritual matters since the birth of Amaterasu. This feeling is so important to Japanese people that it is inconceivable that any other outcome could have ever happened, and it's left us with an immense sense of pride."

This, along with a thousand other reasons, have made it so over a million Japanese youths that simply refuse to leave their home - they order everything they'll ever need online, and work from home (at least some of them). This isn't quite a national travesty, but it's left many with a feeling of malaise that Japan's future is simply spent at great apartment complexes with thousands of people that never leave their homes."

POLITICS_RAZAK_DESC:0 "Being born with connections is key to succeeding in Malaysia. At least, that's what Najib Razak believes. Having been born in a politician family meant that Najib followed the family tradition and slowly climbed through a gauntlet of governorships and mayorships until eventually being elected by the KMM as the Party's leader. Of course, with the KMM being the only real relevant party in Malaysia means that quickly Najib received a lot of power and influence across Malaysia. In a platform of hawkish desires against Singapore and populist corporatism, Najib has gained the approval of most of the population as the continuation of the Malaysian tradition of having the same political party, but with lots of different people inside of it. Now, what will Najib do towards creating this new national project is to be seen."
POLITICS_FERDINAND_ROUMALDEZ_DESC:0 "Born from a family of oligarchs and pro-Japanese collaborators, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Roumaldez Jr. has been engineered his whole life to succeed his mother and father in maintaining the "National-Revolutionary" regime of the "New Philippines". This national programme has been, practically speaking, a proccess of handing over the Philippine economy further and further to dependence with Japan. Of course, Japanese authorities back and approve of this regime and do little in the way of stopping the cycle of corruption and kleptocracy rampant across the country. There is a silver lining however, as the Philippines has continued to grow economically in large percentages due to Japanese management of several sectors of the economy, although this remains one of the most incredibly controversial and violently contested parts of the Japanese "assistance" to Philippine independence. Where does Bongbong come in? Simple.\n\n He is a replaceable cog in the machine, although a key one."
POLITICS_AIRLANGGA_DESC:0 "A genius economic manager and brilliant scholar of Indonesian politics, Airlangga's position is not entirely meritocratic, but certainly much of it came from his own personal efforts. His father had assisted Suharto in his efforts to keep Indonesia's economy growing, although a lot of it came from sending underpaid workers to Japanese factories to make clothes and other basic manufacturing items. According to Airlangga's studies, clothing production is one of the best ways to grow an economy fast and easy, and much of Indonesia's national economy has indeed grown strongly under the Sphere. Continuing his economic orchestra, Airlangga has made several public statements emphasizing the trickling down of wealth to the average Indonesian, and that Japan has helped bring Indonesia's economic independence and national freedom. This has brought a national optimism towards the future, where a supposed eventual furthering of economic independence will make Indonesia a powerhouse on its own right, no longer needing as much aid and Japanese influence as it's getting now."

Backed by one of the largest and most stable economies in the Pacific, Japan continuously funds and explores, excitedly, future possibilities. Robots are very common across all facets of life and smart housing has been a normal case in metropolitan areas. Even our overseas territories are seeing this progress, despite their status as frontiers. This has resulted in immense prosperity overall for the people of Japan, although said prosperity has brought stagnating birthrates and an increasingly recluse population."

JPNflavor.1.t:0 "Written With a Splash of Death"
JPNflavor.1.desc:0 "Mishima Yukio had seen the Empire of Japan go through a tremendous war, an economic miracle, and a subsequent transformation into the unquestioned East Asian superpower in influence and manufacturing. He had seen Japan find itself at the edge of greatness only to strategically retreat and honorably surrender as an agreement with greater powers, now all of them either slouched into materialism or outright dead as a great power (or both, even). Thus, Japan's rising force in the World has been astonishing for the aging Mishima. Despite this, his heart and spirit, young still as age catches up to his erotic, fatal and romanticist predilections. His hunched back and hurt shoulders can barely drive a car, and his morning jogs and workouts transformed into internet browsing and reading.\n\nMishima felt his body weakening every single day. His teeth grew frailer, his previous monumental muscular form had become atrophied and weak, his mind ever the more reaching closer to senility as he felt his medication's dosage increase. Yet, despite it all, Mishima still had life to him, and he had long become one of the most widely respected and beloved writers of Japan, dubbed "The Last Romantic in Tokyo". And, well, that's what he was. The last of his kind - restless bohemians of a lost century past, where all his contemporaries had long since perished like candlelights in a shrine. His candle, however, refused to die down from lack of fuse or wax. Instead, he envisioned a reckoning of his youthful romantic spirit and destruction of his insultingly weak body; A final destruction of the body, so the spirit may go free.\n\nMishima Yukio left Shinjuku, his home ward of the Tokyo Metropolis, and drove out in high speed towards Miyaezaka Highway, C1, near Chiyoda. There, he violently turned the wheel towards the other side of the highway, violently crashing his car into other cars, buses, and finally into a restaurant, which quickly catched fire as the car burst into violent flames and molten steel, Mishima's body becoming a mangled mess."

The car combusted into flames, riding into a window. It appears that from Mishima's blog, a cryptic poem appeared citing his dissatisfaction and despair with his increasing fragility and physical illness, whilst his mind "rode forward like a steel horse". The accident happened scarily close to the National Diet, and many in it demanded that the Mishima Estate pay up for damages, whilst many sympathized with Mishima's suicidal performance art.

As our territories had overwhelmingly voted against it, the United Nations had decided to do a compromise and allow the Dutch to keep their New Guinean posessions. As the decades went on, we've developed a much closer bond to the Dutch than the rest of the East Indies colonies ever did, and this bond made us stick out like a sore thumb in Asia. Once our independence had been achieved in 1987, the government in Jakarta has been extremely aggressive towards us, and now they've shown their true colors, with the intention to destroy our unique nation and trample over our sovereignity.\n\nThey must know, thus, that we will bury them here.

Due to the decades of loyalty and ties to the Dutch, alongside the hundreds of thousands of Indo-Eurasian refugees that arrived in New Guinea over the years, the country has a much more Dutch-oriented culture than the Indonesian counterpart. As tensions built up over the years since the nation's independence, alongside a cooling of relations with the United States, the Republic of Indonesia has declared war on New Guinea, stating that it is a nescessary step to end colonialism in Oceania."

Nonetheless, finding himself in alignment with the Soviets, in a sort of Gaddafi-like syncretic left-wing nationalism, his energetic personality and deep commitment to his values have made him popular with many New Guineans."

WNE.177.desc: "As New Guinea recovers from the invasion by Indonesia, it became clear to political analysts that the New Vision New Guinea Party had all but collapsed in popularity, primarily due to the failure of outgoing President, Vic Hayes, and his cabinet from predicting Indonesia's invasion and preparing with more efficacy. With this in mind, it is not surprising that the populist democratic socialist and retired actor Humbertus Knoch has won the elections outright, becoming the first Muslim President of New Guinea. Despite his lack of political experience, his charming, energetic personality brought together many of New Guinea's tribes and minorities as a unified ticket. Nonetheless, many criticize what they call "rule by Hollandiawood" and often find themselves skeptical of his idealistic programme."

WNE.178.t: "NVNG wins in New Guinea [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.178.desc: "As New Guinea recovers from the invasion by Indonesia, it became clear to many that the grand coalition put together and led by the New Vision New Guinea Party has managed to weather the storm of the invasion and pulled off sufficient votes to retain power. Campaigning under a \"intelligent government\" motto, NVNGP has kept the democratic socialist and left-wing nationalist establishment from holding power, instead continuing to etch their programme of socialist managerialism and technocracy in New Guinean politics. Diplomatic rhetoric has been shifting as well, with more and more pro-Australia comments and statements made by the Government, which has greatly worried the Soviet Ambassador in Hollandia, who's called the recent results \"concerning\"."

WNE.179.t: "VNG wins in New Guinea [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.179.desc: "As New Guinea recovers from the invasion by Indonesia, it became clear that neither the technocratic experiment nor the democratic socialist establishment in New Guinea could hold weight in the face of overwhelming scrutiny. Thus, due to his intense, firebrand and bellicose comments towards Indonesia and appeals to profound patriotism, Geert Wilders has won the elections in New Guinea. Proclaiming the victory against Indonesia to be an \"act of God\", Wilders has made many statements which Muslim groups have called \"islamophobic\". Nonetheless, the election gave him a comfortable majority in Parliament and has allowed him to pass sweeping legislation, including the recognition of LGBTQ marriage in New Guinea, the first place in Southeast Asia to achieve this."
WNE.179.a: "A European socialist in Asia. Fascinating."
