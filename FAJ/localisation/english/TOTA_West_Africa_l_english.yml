BIA_5nbw_desc:0 "The colonizers and oppressors in Abuja have attacked our friends in Benin and on us in the name of "National Reclamation". As it turns out, however, the past four wars haven't taught them much, and it should already be obvious to them that we're not going down so easily. To war!"
BIA_infinite_money_desc:0 "The main envy of Abuja and its gang is that the Igbo states have massive amounts of oil - to a ridiculous level. We have so many oil fields and oil rigs dotted across the country that it's practically made our economy a terrifying surplus for the past few decades. We (Benin and Biafra) are the largest growing economies in Africa, and are as economically strong as Nigeria on its own! We will pull through and one day even be wealthier than them, be through blood or through peace. For now, however, we are one of the richest countries in Africa, and things only seem to be getting better."
BIA_strong_democracy_desc:0 "Whilst our democracy is dominant-party, it doesn't mean others have no representation. The main reason we've stuck to a slightly more biased system is due to the national emergency occuring to our west, and how we cannot let ourselves grow in bickering within our own nation. The majority of the population wholeheartedly approves this compromise, especially against Nigeria's brutal military dictatorship. Perhaps we soon will free them, too."
BIA_strong_democracy_1_desc:0 "As our democracy grows, it means that other parties have gotten more chances at representing themselves in greater scopes and we've only gained from it - our people are happier and trust our government more, and thus our government can function better, despite all the differences."
BIA_cultural_naissance_desc:0 "Zambia had Zamrock. We, taking their mantle of the cultural paragon of modern Africa, have given massive investments in national culture and have given hundreds of artists opportunities to independently release their music from international labels, only then to sit at the negotiating table with the likes of MGM, Warner Bros, and many others. Not only this, but our cinema is also growing evermore popular beyond West Africa, as our greatly diverse territory allows for various genres of filmmaking and fun concepts to be tried out in our fledgling nation. Little government censorship also means that, generally, people don't need to be afraid of what to read about or talk about. This, of course, has brought immense wealth to our cultural heritage."
NGA_renewed_nationalism_desc:0 "Despite the immense problems surrounding Nigeria's economic disparity and the brutal repression of the ruling Junta, the fearless zeal of the Nigerian people within and without have allowed most of these problems to be put aside for now in the faith of a victory against Biafra and its puppets. We will win, and the whole World will tremble!"
NGA_5nbw_desc:0 "The neocolonialist puppets of mercenaries and of foreign corporations in Enugu and Benin City have provoked us at the border again to try and destroy our nation. We say, for the fifth time; "No More!" And they will see the mighty hammer of Justice fall down upon them."
AMB_falling_apart_desc:0 "Our newborn nation struggles deeply with factionalism and tribalism as regional warlords make it so both entities in the Southern Cameroons function more as alliances between regional factions, rather than actual, cohesive polities. This is deeply troubling for the maintenance of the Anglophone states in the Southern Cameroons."

It is thus unsurprising that once Biafra found peace once more and its oil exports resulted in increasingly better quality of life, more and more Biafran-born artists, musicians, poets, writers all would define Biafra as one of Africa's foremost nations in the world of artistic expression. It was unsurprising then that as new social and cultural phenomena spilled from the western world, Biafra always seemed to be its most eager adopter, resulting in Biafra sticking out like a sore thumb compared to its more conservative and traditional neighbors, all the while new movements and ideas boil up from the Biafran people.\n\n\n\n\n£texticon_idea_crisis_of_postmodernity\n\n\n\n\n"

WNE.2.t: "Biafra Wins Fifth Nigerian-Biafran War [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.2.desc:0 "Miraculously, the Biafran state and its satellite, the Republic of Benin have continued to survive against every single attempt at incursions from Nigeria. Despite the odds being stacked against them as Abuja's economy, population and military get larger and larger, especially under a military junta, the Biafran people's resolve to defend their rights as Igbo nationalists has refused to concede even an inch of territory. The humiliating peace treaty thus concedes even further sectors of Nigerian industry to Biafra, and demands billions of dollars in reparations. The peace deal continues with the smackdown by forcing Nigeria to publicly admit to fabricating the incident at the border, and marking the continuation of Nigeria's Humiliation Era."
WNE.2.a: "Land of the Rising Sun, we love and Cherish!"
WNE.3.t: "Nigeria Wins Fifth Nigerian-Biafran War [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.3.desc:0 "It seems that the sword is mightier than the pen, at least in Nigeria's case. The latest incursion into Biafran and Beninese-Edo territory has proven to be the first success in a long time for Nigeria, and resulted in the complete dissolution of the Republic of Benin, along with a humiliating peace deal for Biafra which demands immense reparations, along with the replacement of Biafra's government to a Nigeria-friendly one. This has proven to be the most controversial part of the peace treaty, and has effectively made Biafra a puppet of Nigeria in all but name. This national humiliation of Biafra has not gone without resistance however, and groups like the "Movement for National Salvation" are fighting to make Biafra free again."

WNE.33.desc:0 "Despite the hundreds of hours of negotiations, ceasefire agreements and extensive attempts to secure peace in the Anglophone regions of the Southern Cameroons, Paul Biya has ordered a military intervention into the area, claiming that the territory is legally Cameroonian and that, due to the fact only a minority of UN nations recognize Ambazonia as indeopendent, that the country should be allowed to retake the region. The Ambazonians, having just gone through a leadership crisis and internal instability, will need to start uniting once more against the Cameroonians if they wish to remain independent."

WNE.34.t: "Cameroon Pacifies Ambazonia [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.34.desc:0 "Paul Biya, the aging leader of Cameroon, has finalized one of his primary goals as President - restore Cameroon's complete borders and suppress Anglophone terrorism. Despite UN cries against the invasion and significant backing from Biafra, the Federal Republic of Ambazonia had little chance against much larger of an enemy. Nonetheless, protestors and guerillas continue to fight against the government in Yaoundé, claiming that intent of genocide - and indeed, the beginnings of one - have already been carried out."
WNE.34.a:0 "C'est nous les Africains..."
WNE.35.t: "Ambazonia Repels Cameroon [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.35.desc:0 "In an incredible twist of fate, and indeed, of luck, the Federal Republic of Ambazonia has managed to repel and rout all Cameroonian forces from the country, destroying the country's army and disintegrating the present dictatorship into a transitional government, which will enact elections soon. Biya himself attempted to flee to the Central African Republic, but was found and executed near the Lom river, after a long shootout with his personal guard against the Ambazonian forces and Cameroonian defectors. Now, the ravaged country will have a long journey of rebuilding, both politically and economically, especially considering French support for Biya's government had all but disappeared by the midst of the Ambazonia War. Now, Ambazonia has received international legal recognition across the World, and Cameroon's new borders have been confirmed in the United Nations."

WNE.69.desc: "South Sudanese President Riek Machar has declared the full unification of South Sudan and the end of the period of chaos within the country after the last rival group was defeated by SPLM forces. Originally a single movement, the SPLM has turned into a wide-reaching coalition which functioned primarily as an anti-EAF, anti-Kony front seeking an independent South Sudan. Now that they've successfully achieved the country's independence, President Riek Machar has stated that there will be a serious commitment to democracy, transitioning away from military government and towards a pro-West perspective within South Sudan, with elections set to occur in about 4 years. From Juba to Renk, South Sudan seems to be free."
WNE.69.a: "Our congratulations to them!"
WNE.70.t: "A New Nation in Africa [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.70.desc: "The Nuer have always been at odds with local authorities, be they Dinka or Arab, and their fierce desire for independence had materialized by the early 2000s when they successfully seized large swaths of South Sudan to defend their pastoral routes and farms. Despite their neutral nature the Nuer leader, Gabriel Tanginye, had further ambitions to successfully cementing the Nuer homeland as a real African nation. Despite protests from Arusha, a peace deal was signed in which the Nuer would retain control of South Sudan north of the densely populated Equatoria region and leave Juba to the EAF. Reports of the stratocratic economy of the Nuers being ineffective in transitioning to a national economy have also surfaced, claiming that the new country is at the edge of collapse."
WNE.70.a: "We'll just have to see what happens."
WNE.71.t: "Heaven Is A Place On Earth [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.71.desc: "News from South Sudan is scarce, but reports seem to indicate that the region’s period of anarchy has come to a close. The Lord's Resistance Army, led by its field commander Joseph Rao Kony, has triumphed over East African Federation forces and the other warlords vying for power. Formed in the late 1980s, the LRA has been kept itself together through persistent use of extreme violence and absolute devotion to its leader, who claims to be God’s latest representative on Earth. No one has a grasp on the full truth of the region’s condition, but the few sources that remain indicate that Kony has started to construct his ideal theocratic state, secured and funded through child soldiery, smuggling rings, and intense religious and nationalist fervour."
WNE.71.a: "Concerning to say the least."
WNE.72.t: "The Arrow Boys Alliance seizes South Sudan [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.72.desc: "As of today, the anarchy that plagued South Sudan has formally ended. Only to resume once more under slightly different circumstances. From what the border observers can gather, the Arrow Boys Alliance under command of Alfred Karaba Onyang has managed to triumph over all other warlords within the territory of South Sudan. Formed as an autonomous self-defense force to protect itself from LRA, the Arrow Boys over the recent years managed to gain strength and in a nearly impossible tactical feat - coming a hard way from the furthest East to the furthest West of the country. Now what remains of South Sudan is effectively a near-anarchic confederacy of local entities, somewhat mimicking the Wild West era within the US. The global reaction so far has been lacking, but it is clear that for now South Sudan is wild and free."
WNE.72.a: "Bizarre."
WNE.73.t: "East African Federation reunites South Sudan [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.73.desc: "East African general Walter Raria has declared the end of hostilities in South Sudan following the end of the EAF’s campaign against the last warlord forces controlling the country. After establishing a buffer state intending to prevent hostilities within South Sudan, EAF forces led by Raria launched several offensives against the hostile warlords of the region, crushing the rival factions and fully stabilising the region. The EAF has announced it will formally integrate South Sudan into the Federation as an equal member, and have applauded the efforts of Raria and the soldiers of the EAF as "A big step towards stabilizing South Sudan and bringing it into the 21st century""
WNE.73.a: "The good guys win."
WNE.74.t: "Nuer Bankrupt; Romanovs Bailout [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.74.desc: "Reports of Nuer mismanagement of the economy seemed to not have been unfounded as the little debt that the Nuer have been able to take in resulted in an immediate default as coffers went empty and governance was made increasingly decentralized and broken. Nonetheless, the largest stakeholders in the Nuer national debt, the Romanov family of the long-dead Russian Empire, have bailed out the country from its debts and instated a practically absolute monarchy over the Nuer, although placing a shell Advisory Council as the main checks and balances to the monarchy. The Romanov Empire, one of few countries in the entire world to have "Empire" as part of its official designation, has proven to be extremely popular with not only the locals but with Russian émigré communities as well."
WNE.74.a: "Incredible."
WNE.75.t: "South Sudan Collapses Again [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.75.desc: "Unsurprisingly, the frail hodgepodge of warlords and self-defense militias in South Sudan have collapsed into infighting after victory against both Joseph Kony's Lord Resistance Army and the East African Federation's forces. As thousands of soldiers mobilize once more, it feels as if the country cannot find respite. The Nuer White Army, the most violent and militaristic of the factions, wishes to secure the ever-illustruous cattle routes and pastoral paths across northeastern South Sudan from alleged tyranny by the Machar government, as the Arrow Boys Militia rises up in earnest to defend against both Nuer supremacy and other minor warlords' atrocities and attacks across the beleaguered region - and what comes next is anyone's guess."

bio_theophilus:0 "Ejected from the Efik city-state of Calabar, the Kalabari Kingdom was formed by Ijaws looking for a new home. At least, that's what the stories told by some elders say. After this founding, the Kalabari Ijaws became a key member of the Slave Trade with their Igbo allies. Amachree I, the founder of the present-day state of Kalabari, died in 1800. Prior to this, the Kalabari city-state was very decentralised and functioned more as an association of riverine islands than an actual kingdom. With time, the islands became closer and eventually became one of the many naval trading empires of the area. The kingdom found itself under intense rivalry with many other city-states in the area such as Bonny and Okrika, both of which often embargoed the kingdom for trade advantages. As European contact with the city-states increased, the British increasingly found themselves intervening to maintain the balance in the area, and the Kalabari had been humiliated by the Brass, to their west. In the early 1880s, a rivalry sprung up in the royal family, which resulted in a civil war and eventual disintegration of most of the Kingdom, having to flee further inland as Europeans slowly took more territory. Forgotten and dissipated for decades, the royal family lived destitute until Nigerian - then Biafran independence, whence they were recognized once more."
bio_alfred:0 "Populated by the Nembe people, the city-state of Twon-Brass is considered the Venice of the Niger Delta, at the frontier of Biafra's dominion. Having traded key resources like palm oil with the Europeans for decades, Brass became very wealthy and had won several conflicts with surrounding rivals. Having lived in relative peace for centuries, the Brass Kingdom was forced inland by the Royal Niger Company and the kingdom had turned to poverty. Realizing the gravity of the situation, William Koko, one of the Nembe kings of Brass, led a raid against the British, which ultimately dissolved the remnants of the kingdom in Nembe City. Becoming an important fishing spot, the island of Brass gained wealth once more, and the Kingdom arose again after Nigerian and later Biafran constitutional restorations."
bio_peter:0 "Little is known about the Owèrrè Kingdom's past. However, its present is more interesting - the local monarch has been notoriously lenient to gambling, cinema and other forms of entertainment. This has made thousands flock everyday to the "Las Vegas of Biafra", where a pocket of wealth is found around an area of less fortunate situations."
bio_enweleana:0 "The Kingdom of Nri is and was one of the most prestigious old Biafran kingdoms, having claimed most of Igboland as its sphere of influence and ultimately became a Biafran national symbol of a national homeland, enticing Biafran nationalists many centuries later. Being birthed by mythical origins in what is estimated to be the 10th century, the deity-ruler Eri had been the first to unify the area and give it power, eventually creating the dynasty presently existent in the Kingdom. As the Kingdom expanded, it sought to absorb, like the Romans, its surrounding groups, and at its zenith had influence all over Igboland and the Benin Kingdom. Having declined further and further into isolation as the slave trade became less important, and eventually nonexistent, the Kingdom found itself put in chokehold by the Benin and Igala kingdoms. The monarchy became somewhat recluse by the early 20th century, and had much de facto power over the mindset of Northwest Igbos. The state can be somewhat described as theocratic, with strong religious authority as part of governance and rituals, including sending tributes to the Eze Nri. Taboos defined the moral code, and these were peacefully enforced as opposed to through violence - a key element of the Nri Kingdom, which believed war was a plague upon the Earth - instead through excommunication from the religious society."
bio_muhammadu:0 "A vassal of the Sokoto Caliphate, the Emirate often existed at the peripheries, merely serving slaves to the Caliphate, and eventually culminated in about half of the entire population of Adamawa being slaves. As the authority in the Caliphate grew weaker through European incursions, the eventual partition of the Sokoto meant that the Adamawa Emirate's institutions had all fallen apart like a house of cards. Rivalries sprang up and the administrations of several periphery vassals had turned to the central government, resulting in total lawlessness in Adamawa for a while, eventually resulting in partition by the British and Germans. The British had appointed a new Caliph, who quickly became a Sultan, and then quickly lost any autonomy. As Biafra became independent, the peace with Nigeria defined Biafra's borders as including all of Adamawa up to the Niger, meaning that Biafra provided autonomy to the area, considering the large Muslim population."

SAF_TOTA_DESC: "As South Africa witnessed the motions of the Cold War becoming increasingly tight-necked and eventually dissipating into reconciliation, its western backers became less enthusiastic about the Apartheid government, generally giving vague overtures to both sides depending on time of day. As South Africa found itself increasingly strangled by forces of discontent, it pulled across the World in its connections, strengthened its position and expanded civil rights in several fields of society, from LGBTQ rights to enfranchisement for many white-passing Coloureds, reforming Apartheid to something with a larger in-group. As moderates felt satiated, the opposition became increasingly radicalized. However, another tool appeared to South Africa's aid - mechanical and robotic police units, first starting with simple experiments to becoming the most technologically advanced police force in Africa, with about 60 percent of its structure being fulfilled by artificial intelligence and robotics. Yet, the flames of discontent appear to be rearing its ugly head once more as South Africa deals with an intense drought from Windhoek to Bloemfontein. Will the Republic of South Africa survive these incoming bouts of discontent once more?"
SEY_TOTA_DESC: "The Seychelles has had a mostly peaceful and otherwise unremarkable history for most of its existence as land and as an inhabited territory - however, the late 20th century would not spare this tropical paradise of the planet's pressures. As a Marxist-Leninist government overthrew the island's provisional government almost immediately after independence, South African-backed mercenaries from across the World, notably being given a carte blanche for Seychelles' fate after this overthrow. This brought sufficient motivation across the mercenary and PMC world - resulting in a large, enthusiastic force of veteran commanders and officers - almost overqualified for the job. As the barely-existent People's Republic of Seychelles dissolved, the actors of said overthrow broke their promises with the former President, instead choosing to create a provisional military authority to manage the island. This provisional authority was never disbanded and Seychelles became an increasingly stratocratic, partially democratic society of mercenaries and wealthy adventurers."
NGA_TOTA_DESC: "Nigeria has not had a good time as an independent nation. Immediately after independence, ethnic conflict plagued the large country, resulting in extremely unequal representation within all three branches of government and the Armed Forces. As this ethnic tension continued, Christian Igbos and other ethnicities broke off, and after years of war, formed the Republic of Biafra. This was a practical death knell for Nigeria, with its oil reserves becoming 70 percent smaller. Yet, the country preservered through a brutal military junta, backing by many countries and a slightly more homogenous society. Nigeria's military officers across decades have attempted to destroy the breakaway republics of Benin and Biafra, to no avail - at least for now, as the fifth of these conflicts rages on and Nigeria braces for what could be a horrifying impact."
MSK_TOTA_DESC: "The Commonwealth of Miskito has had a wartorn, short existence. Shortly after the beginning of the Nicaraguan Civil War, the Contras allied themselves with the Miskito and other English-speaking Nicaraguan Creole peoples from Corn Island to Bluefields as a redoubt against the Sandinista communists. As time went on, and months became years and years became decades, the Contras leadership has waned in its domineering power over their former allies, resulting in the declaration of the Miskito Commonwealth as an independent state, recognized by the Nicaraguan Government-in-exile (hosted in Bluefields). Now, as various groups share power and have to force eachother to stand down from dispute after dispute, not many believe there is much breathing room for the Commonwealth itself as the world tightens around its seams."

NGA.6.desc: "Afolabi had been bashing his head against the paper pile in front of him for hours. \"This is the worst job I could have asked for,\" he thought. Nonetheless, it had the best pay Abuja had to offer for someone of his background, and he nonetheless pressed on lest he be purged for lacking loyalty to the Nigerian state.\nThe roadblocks ahead of him were nothing short of impenetrable - he'd been calling fifteen different royals over the past five hours and hasn't had a single concession. As he looked on to his slightly clouded glasses in the table, he thought there must be a better way - a way to get this shit sorted, once and for all.\n\nSo he thought, how would one be able to plan what cannot be planned..?"
NGA.6.a: "Request a royal purge to the Junta and get these reforms out."
NGA.6.b: "Work with what he's got."

NGA.2001.t: "Brilliant Green"
NGA.2001.desc: "A band of armed men stood atop the front balcony of the Presidential Complex, banners waving in success as the cheering masses countered the booming voices of the men with megaphones.\n“THE REVOLUTION IS A SUCCESS! THE JUNTA IS DEAD! DEMOCRACY IS HERE!”\nFrom this day forward, the new government promises the beginning of a democratization process, and imminent elections. With varying factions aiming to take the rains of this new government, the new administration has ultimately decided…"

Your hearing date will be decided within the week...”\n“...we have no choice but to let you go without compensation…”\n\nThe office was lively with the clattering of keys as letters of dismissal were being filled out and delivered to various generals, some tied to corruption, some tied to the junta, some plain inefficient. It was a long day's work, tedious but very necessary."
NGA.2002.a: "Thus unto tyrants."

Bumping shoulders with his colleague, they reviewed and surmised:\n“Yeah, this works. But what abou-”\nBefore he could finish his sentence, the diplomat interrupted.\n“Unlike the previous bastards, we'll pay regularly and the correct amounts. No more IOUs.”"
NGA.2003.a: "I'm sold."

WNE.198.t: "Liberia Flares Up Again [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.198.desc: "Despite the mediated truce and negotiations, alongside observance by Soviet and French peacekeepers in Monrovia for the latest election in the Democratic Republic of Liberia, which has seen Winston Tubman win another 5-year term. Citing concerns of Tubman's age (despite good health), \"dynastic rule\" in Monrovia and the fairness of the elections, Charles Taylor's forces have begun an attack on Monrovia and are already surrounding Montserrado County, which is held together by peacekeepers and local forces. As foreign aid pours in, many wonder if Liberia will ever have a future of peace."
WNE.198.a: "Time to have another go, eh?"

WNE.199.t: "DRL Unifies Liberia [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.199.desc: "With French and Soviet backing, many have long recognized the Democratic Republic of Liberia as the legitimate successor to the previous Liberian government. Now, from the Lofa highlands to Harper Bay, the rule of the Tubman family is firmly secure, glued tightly to social-democratic and progressive, pro-Soviet ideological roots. After a violent and bloody campaign across the nation, it seems that the Guinean-backed LURD and Taylor's forces have all but collapsed and surrendered unto Monrovia. With that said, much rebuilding needs to be done, and few know if this is truly the end of Liberia's wars."
WNE.199.a: "Let us hope."

WNE.200.t: "LURD unifies Liberia [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.200.desc: "Despite little international backing besides very enthusiastic aid from Conakry, the Republic of Liberia under the Liberians United For Reconciliation and Democracy alliance have successfully expelled the Soviet ally in Monrovia and Taylor's stronghold in Sinoe County and Grand Gedeh. As the country rebuilds, the creation of a united patriotic front for reconstruction has been the main focus of the new Government, which has raised some concerns about democratic backsliding."
WNE.200.a: "Liberia needs safety."

WNE.201.t: "Taylor Unifies Liberia [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.201.desc: "Marked internationally as a war criminal and tyrant, but otherwise deeply popular with the locals under his rule, Charles Taylor and forces loyal to his RUF have successfully unified Liberia. As the country reels from the siege in Monrovia and the problems of international recognition, Taylor finds himself as Liberia's absolute autocrat. Having commanded now millions of loyal rabid followers and the purge of \"anti-Patriotic\" forces deemed disloyal or otherwise dangerous to his rule, Taylor has effectively made Liberia his kingdom, centered around himself and his charimastic command of crowds."
WNE.201.a: "Emperor of a pile of ash."
