FRA_jupiterian_president:0 "Man as Jupiter, Jupiter as President"
FRA_jupiterian_president_desc:0 "Ever since the rise of De Gaulle many decades ago, France has been a Presidential Dictatorship in all capacities. Particularly after May 68, the administration became more pragmatic by agreeing to more demands than expected, thus bringing in a noticeable support from the left for the Gaullist system. However, these events were from many decades ago. The position of President was lacking honor and dignity, and with the advent of Macron, the position of Head of State was given newfound prestige by Emmanuel Macron through his Jupiterian personality and myth-making, creating a miasma of mystery around him, one that has defined his governance for years."
FRA_burden_beyond:0 "The Burden from Beyond"
FRA_burden_beyond_desc:0 "Our gamble on West Africa, giving up on North Africa very quickly after 1957, meant that we have retained an extremely large swath of territory over Africa as integral parts of France. These territories, having a profound francophilia which only spurred further on by reform from the European part of France. As millions have left Algeria and other posessions for West Africa, an increasingly large amount of intermingling has created an entrenched, profound attachment between the two parts of France - European and African (not to mention Polynesia and others!). France thus, with all these new dignities given to the non-European populations, thus needed to provide more infrastructure, more rights and more welcoming attitudes. With radical civic nationalism, it appears France managed it. Yet, despite the good intentions and profound attachment between the parts of France all over the World, the crushing realities of infrastructure issues, connections and supply have made it difficult to provide uniform enforcement of policy and services."
FRA_bulwark_europe:0 "Bulwark of Europe"
FRA_bulwark_europe_desc:0 "The European Economic Community has had an incredible transformation into the European Union, which developed further and further in a system centered wholly around France's dictation of European policy. Despite the thorns and difficulties, such as Italy's government change among other challenges, France stands tall as the Hegemon and Bulwark of European Unity, and thus will remain with this role for as long as it can hold it with pride."
FRA_europeanist_geopol:0 "The Pinay Doctrine"
FRA_europeanist_geopol_desc:0 "Antoine Pinay was central to forming France's standing in the international stage. Asserting total control over the frontier provinces of France's patrimony and profoundly asserting France as a global Republic with deeply entrenched values of liberty and equality under a civic identity. Antoine Pinay's foreign policy thus, in this situation, played both sides off - the United States constantly seeing European policy moving to friendlier relations with the Soviet Bloc prior to any normalization done by the Americans - and the Soviets seeing potential new grounds for trade allies, culminating into the mutual access between French and Soviet networks and web infrastructure, and being finalized into state doctrine through the idea of Europeanism, which seeks to combine Eurasianist foreign policy and Atlanticist foreign policy to form what is best for Europe."

POLITICS_MACRON_DESC:0 "One can only shudder at what Emmanuel Macron, the representative of the Republic is planning, considering, projecting at any time. Undoubtedly one of the more meteoric rising stars in the Union for the New Republic, France's primary and most important party - though it exists more as a machinic and byzantine bureaucracy of politicking, bickering, and factional disputes under the leadership of the Head of State. Macron rose through the drudgery of local politics, African affairs, and other deputy positions into ministries across the board, mainly by presenting himself as a cheerful, friendly, and hardworking bureaucrat. As Minister of Economy and Finance, Macron initiated an intensive reform of the French economy, causing it to grow several points of percentage more than usual, streamlining the infrastructure connecting the Metropole with its African districts. Having helped form the appropriately named "Macron Network", his work has allowed supply and direction between local governments from Europe and Africa to finalize into a perfect machine - the policy was widely supported by Africans as a bringer of development and prosperity to a region that still needed attention, even after further investments going back to the 60s. With these achievements and his steady hardworking demeanor, Macron was chosen by the Council of Ministers to head the Republic after an internal election. With the full prowess of the State behind him, Macron's old personality took a sharp turn towards the image of a cold, calculating and powerful Head of State, invoking the mythology of Jupiter in his policies and outlook - particularly galvanized during riots in 2018 which were brutally suppressed by the Army, ordered directly by the President.\nEmmanuel Macron, then, is an enigma; a wildcard; a wielder of the state as carrot, and as stick. His designs can never be made certain, save for one fact: they could shake the very world."

WARSAW_TREATY_ORGANIZATION: "Warsaw Treaty Organization"

POLITICS_CORBYN_DESC:0 "Nobody can deny Jeremy Corbyn the title of "lifelong socialist". He was not only born to two Labour campaigners, but was active in socialist orgs while still in school. Later in life, while travelling in Chile, Corbyn saw the mass popular support for Salvador Allende's Popular Unity alliance and its welding of folk, artistic, and intellectual traditions at the Santiago May Day Parade. Staying for a few more years, he got an exclusive look into the nascent Cybersyn project and was stunned at the prospect of cybernetically-managed socialism, and the synthesis of popular folk support and cutting-edge technological innovation. Returning to the UK, he struggled to propel these ideas as Labour's rightist leaders continued to side-line the left of the party. Despite this, his ideals never wavered, much like his presence on Labour's left, working through many decades.\nDuring the 80s and 90s, Corbyn was found fighting strongly for a socialism that incorporated LGBT rights and liberation, that resisted Apartheid, and kept the workers strong. It was the 2008 Global Crash that created a great opportunity for Corbyn's ideals of a cybernetically-guided government to take fruit, when it was pushed as policy to help mitigate the recession to come. This policy's success drew great attention and only helped to further crystallise into a sort of "Social Technocracy" governance, though Corbyn stayed firmly aligned with the socialist cause. Victory in Labour's leadership elections transferred into victory in the 2020 General Election, and his ideas now sit at the helm of society, after decades of effort and work. It seems it all paid off in the end for one of Europe's most tech-savvy socialists."

ENG_postwar_comp_heritage:0 "Bletchley’s Computing Legacy"
ENG_postwar_comp_heritage_desc:0 "Following the successes of Bletchley Park's decryption efforts during the Second World War and after acquiring the schematics to the FET transistor, the British government has made sure to keep a close involvement with the development of computing technologies. This has manifested in several ways, such as the grants awarded to further develop the Colossus computer after the war, or directly assisting in Alan Turing's theories and research. These were simple developments compared to the surprisingly lax declassification of their research which enabled an explosion in computer research and manufacturing firms to be set up and consolidated over the subsequent decades, with the most notable groups being Sinclair and Acorn - two powerhouses that have continued to push greater advancements and provide great benefits to our economy.

Thankfully, our relationships to these oil-rich territories, whether Commonwealth nations or not, have become and remained strong. The United Kingdom has thus become a key link connecting Europe and Africa together, acting as a bridge between the two continents."
ENG_post_empire_syndrome:0 "Post-Empire Syndrome"
ENG_post_empire_syndrome_desc:0 "For most of the UK's history, the idea of Empire held together the nation as a single voice and identity, successfully holding together the country. Yet, with decolonization, the idea of Empire had become severely outdated and disregarded - with this, the British public's opinion of the United Kingdom has devolved into a very frail, faltering interest in an united British identity. This has only become worse with the increasing post-colonial immigration of previous territories of the Empire, arriving to the British Isles to work and live, causing a rise in nativist populism among many political circles."
ENG_home_commonwealth:0 "Home of the Commonwealth"
ENG_home_commonwealth_desc:0 "Compared to other empires of the time, Britain developed a much earlier system of regional autonomy within its colonies called the British Commonwealth of Nations. This group was later renamed to just the Commonwealth of Nations as it was modernised during post-war decolonisation as a method to not just help maintain British interests in these regions, but also to ensure that commerce stayed strong and to celebrate their shared heritage. Starting as the British Commonwealth of Nations, it's obvious that the United Kingdom is the most senior of the members. This has its benefits in the form of continued international prestige and relevance, better trade deals, and generally a stronger weight to our words in the United Nations. "
ENG_disunited_union:0 "Disunited Union"
ENG_disunited_union_desc:0 "For centuries, the governance of the United Kingdom has slowly centralised more and more into the hands of Westminster, in the nation’s capital. While this perfectly served our needs during the times of Empire, burgeoning nationalist movements in Wales and Scotland - and even movements in our larger cities - demanding greater regional powers have picked up a lot of steam since the conclusion of the Second World War, and that’s without mentioning the difficult issue of Northern Ireland. While efforts to decentralise have assuaged the most pressing of concerns, these movements remain strong and popular in their respective regions, but we cannot let them get too strong, lest we see a complete dissolution of our great Union.

ENG_post_industrial_blues_desc:0 "Despite being the nation to initiate both industrial revolutions, the winds of economic change have dramatically shifted since the end of the Second World War, with our production and extraction economies shrinking under the shadow of service-orientated economics. This has most acutely affected the North and Midlands of England, as well as Wales, where manufacturing and mining were staple careers for hundreds of thousands of people. Now these regions stagger into destitution as investment dries up and our national wealth concentrates into Southern England - London in particular."

WES_europes_lighthouse:0 "Europe's Lighthouse"
WES_europes_lighthouse_desc:0 "The Republic of Westphalia is the most successful experiment in continental European democracy in the 21st and 20th century. As France slowly subsumed its democracy under the Gaullist boot and Italian populists take over, we've consistently remained one of the most democratic, uncorrupt, free and prosperous nations in modern history. Our commitment to liberal democracy is thus unbreakable, and no amount of meddling by foreign powers will change that."
WES_frail_identity:0 "Frail National Identity"
WES_frail_identity_desc:0 "The Westphalian identity has only existed for a couple of decades, none of it with the furor and militancy of the old German unification. Seen as the poster child for liberal internationalism, our nationalists are rarely nationalists for our country, and instead wish to create a united Germany once again. This helps make our national identity extremely weak and uncared for, something which hasn't been adressed very well."

The Romans found themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place - and the country split up. Yet, ever since the dissolution of the Monarchy and the several decades of political conflict with the bourgeois Center that suppressed dignity for Italy, a new light shone through once the Left and the Right decided to follow the examples of early patriotic socialists of Italy and combine into a 'rossobruni', where the Lethargic Center, backed by international finance, was finally dislodged and thus Italy has begun finding its dignity once more. However - the decoupling of these parasites has caused immense uproar across the nation - and our political motions are constantly deadlocked. Something must be done!"

Millions of "sleeping Italians" live in the United States, Argentina, Brazil... yet our language can be best described as moribund when compared to English or French, incredible global languages where millions away from its heartland speak its tributes religiously. Our Libyan memory, once composed of a million Italians in the Fourth Shore, have all but faltered to the sands of time. The Eritreans only murmur a soft, croaked and raspy Italian in the oldest of generations, gathering dust in the city of Asmara.

The very moment the Carnation Revolution had shown its ugly rear as a plot by communists, gypsies and other unpleasant elements, the Azorean and Madeiran people refused to accept the new, illegitimate government in Lisbon. As we became orphans of our beloveed homeland, near 50 years have passed since we've bedgrudgingly proclaimed our co-independence. Whilst not many of our "Founding Fathers" are still alive to tell the tales of an Azores that once belonged to our whole national body, the people of all generations, then and now, have done Herculean work in ensuring that the message of fighting Communism in these islands remains alive, be it through violence or through cultural pervasiveness."

The Frankenstein amalgamation of parts from Japan, Bulgaria, and the EU represented two decades of repairs and upgrades, duties the Politiburo saw to with Benedictine diligence. Hard drives, solid state drives, and even magnetic tape formed the "brain" of the First Secretary, yet his consciousness was far beyond the sum of his parts, spanning over 100 years of life. As a newly-elected Politburo minister, Selmani was instructed to deal with generating a speech related to Albania’s 14th Five-Year Plan on account of his background in computer sciences. While others planned the celebrations, he was in a sacred, solemn place. This was where Albania's greatest proletarian resided.\n\nThe two conversed. Daily missives were fed into the computer and the system provided an output via paper receipt that approximated Enver’s views - a key function for state media. Daily updates done, Lulian typed up the most important question of the day.\n\n"First Secretary of the Party of Labour of Albania, Enver Hoxha, what direction should be taken for 2021's Five Year Plan?"\n\nThe computer paused for a few minutes, a promising, but unnerving wait. Lulian took a sip of his old, re-heated coffee. It was past its prime but Lulian needed it after so long hunched over the screen.\n\nAnother receipt printed out. A lengthy dissertation was provided, although in unbearably obscure and cryptic Marxese. Lulian felt somewhat intimidated by the otherwise inconspicuous printed paper, doing some small revisions with Hoxha's consent, primarily to "ensure mass understanding of the contents".His work done, Lulian stood up and stretched his back after a long stint sitting on his worn-out office chair. He bid the system farewell via a new input, as was Lulian’s routine, but as he left the room, unbeknownst to him, the console printed out one last receipt, as Hoxha was left with his only company - a feed of multiple cameras in Tirana:"

The Kingdom of Greece was left a rump state, propped up and secured only by the British Royal Navy, on the Aegean Islands and Crete.\n\nAs the 20th Century marched on, the Kingdom of Greece was eventually granted Cyprus from the UK, and managed to reach some reconciliation and eventually interdependence with Turkey, neither nation wanting further Soviet encroachment. With the new millennium, a robust and attractive tourism sector, as well as its other service sector offerings has allowed the Kingdom to be relatively economically secure and independent, but for security, it remains almost entirely dependent on continued British and Turkish presence."

With the collapse of the "National Renewal" alliance, the radical elements inside of the country were quick to capitalize on the situation, as the north becomes marked by riots and strikes.
