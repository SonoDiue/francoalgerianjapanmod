WNE.139.t: "Pilgrim 1 Leaves Earth [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.139.desc: "The first stage of the Pilgrim Program has safely departed Earth today for its final destination of the red planet, Mars. The shuttle will head towards the Moon and rendezvous with the Jamestown Lunar Base in about a week’s time, where, once the final checks have been made to the new Transplanetary Transport Shuttle (TPTS) - a collaborative project between NASA, Interkosmos, and the ECSA - the crew of six will depart for Mars on an eight month journey, hopefully landing on Mars in September."
WNE.139.a: "Bon Voyage!"
WNE.141.t: "Pilgrim 1 Leaves the Moon [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.141.desc: "We have reports that after a slight delay and further final checks, the crew of Pilgrim 1 have finally departed from Jamestown Lunar Base and are heading to Mars. The mission itself has been heralded as a monumental achievement in the easing of geopolitical tensions between the USSR and the USA, led by now-former-President Alexander Johnson. Many have likened it to the solidarity shown by the Apollo-Soyuz mission of 1981 that saw NASA astronauts and Interkosmos cosmonauts come together to shake hands in space. Pilgrim 1’s crew should land on Mars in September when we will hopefully see humanity take its first steps on a new planet."
WNE.141.a: "Godspeed you, brave explorers!"
WNE.142.t: "Humanity’s First Steps on Mars [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.142.desc: "Billions around the world tuned in to watch humanity’s latest step into the stars as Pilgrim 1 made its final descent to Mars’ surface. After touching down, many held their breath to see who would be the first person to walk on another planet, but remarkably, these first steps were taken together in a remarkable show of solidarity with NASA astronaut and Mission Commander, Stephanie Wilson, and Interkosmos cosmonaut and Flight-Engineer, Oleg Kononenko, walking together, arm in arm. Mars’ first steps have thus come to represent the spirit of collaboration and togetherness that space exploration has achieved in spite of the political strife seen on Earth."
WNE.142.a: "How inspiring!"
WNE.143.t: "Drilling Excursions on Mars [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.143.desc: "As the Pilgrim mission progresses onward, it appears that excursions towards drilling and exploring Mars’ vast surface have begun. Whilst many in NASA, Interkosmos, and the ECSA have optimistic outlooks, some more skeptical scientists have stated that little of value will be found in the Martian crust. Nonetheless, the world looks on as drilling begins on the second planet in human civilization, both for research and material benefit. In other news, the Ares Transorbital Station, the new interplanetary and international hub for space missions, has reached Mars’ orbit and will begin assisting the Pilgrim Program, helping to coordinate its next missions between Earth and Mars."
WNE.143.a: "We can only hope it’ll be worth it."
WNE.144.t: "Water On Mars! [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.144.desc: "Despite the cries of naysayers to humanity’s presence in space, and with the assistance of the Ares Transorbital Station and the diligence of the Pilgrim 1 crew, the greatest discovery in astronautics has been unveiled today, as deposits of liquid water have been found on Mars. This is particularly exciting for two reasons. Like with the discovery of ice on the Moon, this would enable Mars to also become a site for launches even further out into the Solar System, but most significantly, this discovery has widened the very slim chances of microbial life possibly being found on the red planet. What will be found from here on, nobody knows…"
WNE.144.a: "Exciting!"
WNE.145.t: "Pilgrim 2 Lands on Mars [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.145.desc: "With Pilgrim 1 having been a jaw-dropping success, further good news has arrived from the red planet as the second shuttle for the Pilgrim mission, Pilgrim 2, has safely arrived on Mars to help resupply the Pilgrim mission and its nascent base. Excitingly, within Pilgrim 2’s storage reside more important equipment to further analyze and drill into Mars, potentially bringing even more discoveries to Earth."
WNE.145.a: "Good luck to them!"
WNE.146.t: "Life On Mars? [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.146.desc: "As if the discovery of liquid water wasn’t significant enough - and one that already seemed impossible to some - we have reports that the combined crews of Pilgrim 1 and Pilgrim 2 have picked up possible living microbes in their latest water analyses at a new dig-site. What appears to be single-cellular life has been found in an underground reservoir, although these reports are unconfirmed. While tests have been conducted at Hopscotch Base, the crews will be handing over samples to the Ares Transorbital Station for further study, with what could be the most incredible discovery of not just the 2020s, but possibly all of human history."
WNE.146.a: "I want to believe."
WNE.147.t: "Pilgrim 3 Lands On Mars [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.147.desc: "As the obviously stupefying implications of alien life, no matter how small, on Mars continue to cause a significant stir in the scientific community, the samples purported to contain single-cell life are being moved from the Ares Transorbital Station to Earth for even further tests with more complex and specialized equipment. They will be sent back with Pilgrim 3, which has landed and will be returning to Earth with the few remaining pioneers of Pilgrim 1. Representatives for the Program have notably been downplaying any wild speculation and frenzy surrounding the obviously sensitive mission, but a quote in particular from a representative has stuck out to many - “Anything is possible, now.”"
WNE.147.a: "Anything?"
WNE.148.t: "LIFE ON MARS! [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.148.desc: "Truly era-defining news has been announced by NASA, Interkosmos, and the ECSA today. The suspicions of many worldwide have been confirmed. The Martian samples, discovered last year before being transported to the ATOS, have been confirmed to contain basic but certifiably living bacteria! Words fail to describe the significance of such a discovery - one that many predict is set to change humanity’s course - as it seems that the first, verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial life has been found. As celebrations ring out worldwide, even in war-torn areas, it seems that space is a little less lonely than it once seemed."
WNE.148.a: "We are not alone."
WNE.149.t: "Humanity’s First Steps on Mars [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.149.desc: "Billions around the world tuned in to watch humanity’s latest step into the stars as Pilgrim 1 made its final descent to Mars’ surface. After a problematic landing, the crew steeled themselves and took the first steps on a foreign planet. In a remarkable show of solidarity, NASA astronaut and Mission Commander, Stephanie Wilson, and Interkosmos cosmonaut and Flight-Engineer, Oleg Kononenko, were seen walking down the ship’s ramp together, arm in arm."
WNE.149.a: "How inspiring."
WNE.150.t: "Ongoing Problems with Pilgrim Program [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.150.desc: "After the unfortunate landing of Pilgrim 1, it seems that the shuttle and crew will remain on Mars for the foreseeable future. However, further problems have been reported by the space agencies, regarding issues with debris from the crash having collided with the pre-landed Habitation Modules. These modules were planned to be used for the construction of a permanent base on Mars, similar to the Jamestown and Zvezda Lunar Bases. With these issues, the launch of the Pilgrim 2 Mission has been brought forward to better resupply Pilgrim 1’s crew. The Ares Transorbital Station is also planned to be moved to Mars, but no changes have been announced for this mission yet."
WNE.150.a: "Let's hope for no more problems."
WNE.151.t: "Pilgrim 1 Crashes on Mars [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.151.desc: "As Pilgrim 1 was due to land on Mars today, an as-yet unidentified issue seems to have caused a catastrophic failure. As billions tuned in to watch, the anticipation soon turned to dread as the control centers were unable to receive any word from the crew. It is believed that Pilgrim 1 has crashed into the surface of Mars with seemingly no survivors. ECSA Director-General Johann-Dietrich Wörner has issued a joint statement from the three agencies offering condolences, not only to the families and friends of those lost, but to humanity as a whole - “Others will follow and surely find their way home. But these explorers were the first and they will remain the foremost in our hearts. Fate has ordained that as those who explored in peace, will now rest in peace.”"
WNE.151.a: "Requiescat in pace"
WNE.152.t: "Pilgrim 2 Launch Expedited [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.152.desc: "Following the dreadful news of the Pilgrim 1 Crash, many have wondered what the future of the Pilgrim Program will hold. Today they received confirmation that NASA, Interkosmos, and the ECSA are dedicated to the program and are expediting the launch of the second mission, Pilgrim 2, so that the crew of Pilgrim 1 can be properly laid to rest and the crash investigated. Pilgrim 2 is due to launch from Earth for the Moon in March, and then launch for Mars after only a week, with a potential landing date in December."
WNE.152.a: "Best of luck to them."
WNE.153.t: "Pilgrim 2 Lands Successfully [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.153.desc: "As the crew of Pilgrim 2 lands their shuttle on Mars, the world’s response has been understandably mixed. As much of a triumph as humanity’s first steps on a new planet has been, it has also dredged up the great feeling of grief experienced in the wake of the Pilgrim 1 crash and the loss of its crew. Cosmonaut and Mission Commander Oleg Artemyev and NASA Astronaut and Flight-Engineer Victor Glover were the first to walk on Mars, taking their first steps together, arm-in-arm as a show of solidarity. The remains of Pilgrim 1 were also finally laid to rest on the Martian surface in what is to become a more permanent Fallen Astronaut Memorial, much like the one on the Moon."
WNE.153.a: "A bittersweet day for humanity."
WNE.154.t: "Base On Mars Finished [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.154.desc: "The world has received photographs and video footage of humanity’s first transplanetary settlement, born of the Pilgrim Program that has seen NASA, Interkosmos, and the ECSA join together in a show of humanity’s future together in space. Reports have come in that the base has been named the Hopscotch Mars Base by the crew as a fun allusion to the Earth-Moon-Mars journey they've undertaken. As millions look on, it appears that humanity has taken its first steps into becoming an interplanetary species. Many governments worldwide - including, surprisingly, several of the competing American governments - have put out statements about this unprecedented progress in human civilization as a whole."
WNE.154.a: "Incredible."
WNE.155.t: "Pilgrim 2 Lands on Mars [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.155.desc: "Following the seemingly-disastrous news of Pilgrim 1’s landing on Mars - its crew having been stranded for the last nine months - a sliver of good news has arrived as the second shuttle for the Pilgrim mission, Pilgrim 2, has arrived on Mars to resupply and assist the stranded, though safe, crew of Pilgrim 1. Despite its expedited launch, Pilgrim 2 excitingly holds much more advanced equipment to aid Pilgrim 1’s original mission of drilling into the Martian surface, as scientists seek to learn more about the red planet."
WNE.155.a: "Everything will be okay, it seems!"
WNE.156.t: "Base On Mars Finished [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.156.desc: "The world has received photographs and video footage of humanity’s first transplanetary settlement, born of the Pilgrim Program that has seen NASA, Interkosmos, and the ECSA join together in a show of humanity’s future together in space. The new base was jokingly referred to as Happy Valley Base by the stranded crew - an ironic idiom meaning “paradise” - which has since stuck as its formal name. As millions look on, it appears that humanity has truly become an interplanetary species. Many governments worldwide - including, surprisingly, several of the competing American governments - have put out statements about this unprecedented progress in human civilization as a whole."
WNE.156.a: "Incredible."
WNE.157.t: "Base On Mars Finished [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.157.desc: "The world has received photographs and video footage of humanity’s first transplanetary settlement, born of the Pilgrim Program that has seen NASA, Interkosmos, and the ECSA join together in a show of humanity’s future together in space. Honouring the fallen Pilgrim 1 crew, the base has been dubbed the Vanguard Mars Base by the Pilgrim 2 crew. While a solemn occasion with the memory of the Pilgrim 1 crew still fresh in the minds of many, millions look on with hope as humanity becomes an interplanetary species. Many governments worldwide - including, surprisingly, several of the competing American governments - have put out statements about this unprecedented progress for human civilization as a whole."
