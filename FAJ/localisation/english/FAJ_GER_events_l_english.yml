GER.2.d:0 " "Mein Führer, the time has come to strike at the heart of our adversaries in Siberia. On your command, we can send our best agent to assasinate the General, paving the way for chaos and instability within their pathetic government. Once the head is severed, the body will falter, and we shall have a golden opportunity to exert our influence and expand our sphere of dominance. This decisive action, will not only weaken Siberia but also send a clear message to the world of the might of the Sigmareich. Your approval is all that stands between us and victory." "

SBR.1.d:0 ""Siberia is in turmoil following the assassination of President Hafiyy. Prime Minister Josnd, away on business, is blocked from returning to the capital by rebellious military forces. The Navy and Marines have seized control of Sokol Airport in Magadan, effectively stranding the Prime Minister in Magadan. Meanwhile, the Army, under Colonel Haj, seems to be resisting the coup attempt. Reports are confusing. While some rebels are securing key areas and arresting officials, there haven't been major clashes with loyalist troops.  This "Siberian Standoff" has created a power vacuum. Who will control Siberia? Will the Prime Minister regain power, or will the military elite seize control? The world watches as this young nation grapples with its future.""
