POLITICS_CHIMAROKE_DESC:0 "Born in Biafra's capital during the mass unrest occuring in the area, Chimaroke Nnamani's life has been all-around defined by the Biafran national project.\n\nQuickly beginning his education in Medicine, he eventually looked into politics, although not quite straying from his medical science roots, joining the Port Harcourt Doctor's Association and rising through the ranks in national relevance. Having proven to be a moderate, lukewarm politician without losing his patriotism, he's become a great star in Biafran politics, especially due to his practical local government results, such as the creation of several education and health centres across Port Harcourt and helping increase the country's national life expectancy through the decades, along with electrifying hundreds of villages and towns.\n\nHe could have lived his whole life as a simple, unremarkable politician who had a good term and did good things. Yet, Fate would strike him and place him at the forefront of a violent skirmish during his term, the fifth since Biafra's independence. Nigeria has already begun attacking Biafra's ally in the west, Benin and seems like they will pierce the front anytime soon... unless if Chimaroke's political and economic skills prove to bring his resolve to save Biafra from humiliation against its former oppressor."
POLITICS_SAMUEL_SAKO_DESC:0 "Little is known about the president of the Federal Republic of Ambazonia's background. Having mostly been known for theological studies and linguistic scholarship, his exposure to Ambazonian intellectual circles made him a zealous defender of English Common Law and protestantism in the "Southern Cameroons" area as it is known by Yaoundé, of which was violently abused by the central government, resulting in a massive rising across the territory. Leading the civilian sector of the movement, which successfully seceded from Cameroon, he was propped up by his military ally, Sisiku Julius. Yet, Julius' real intention was to use Samuel as a puppet, of which resulted in a conflict in the infant nation. This conflict comes from the military veterans that fought for Ambazonia and the civilian intellectuals in the main towns and cities. The country's provisional Government has managed to keep things under control, but any show of weakness could even mean the Nation's death..."
POLITICS_BABAGANA_MONGUNO_DESC:0 "A highly experienced and decorated military general, Monguno's actual life and background is very unimportant to the actual needs of the Nigerian Nation and its military regime. The main concern of all involved in the Junta is to restore Nigeria's territorial integrity and secure its freedom against perceived neocolonialism, such as in Biafra and Benin. Retiring from his carreer as General, he has begun focusing all his energies into making the latest skirmish against Biafra and its puppet §Rthe last he'll ever need to think about.§!"
POLITICS_LUCKY_IGBINEDION_DESC:0 "Lucky's life really began in the United States. Having gained a cosy seat (primarily because he is technically royalty) in the American South's primary universities after Segregation ended, Lucky gained a top-notch education and thus proved his mettle once the Benin Republic needed new and young politicians with a lot of spunk. And so, he quickly got to work in the early 2000s in local governments, and eventually secured the presidency of Benin after his fantastic magnum opus, the Edo State Institute of Technology and Management. However, being good at intellectualism isn't the only skill needed to save your nation from Nigerian revanchism; the Nigerian Army is starting to march into Benin, and both Biafra and Benin fight for their lives as the mighty Abuja looks to reclaim its territories."
TOTA_NAME:0 "Twilight of the Anthropocene"
TOTA_DESC:0 "Humanity's discovery of the transistor as early as the 1930s brought about an accelerated and exponential growth of technology under the most developed nations, with developing nations coming out of colonial empires catching up quickly. As the Internet came around in the 1960s and superpowers around the World scrambled to make their own versions, the world found itself in unprecedented technological progress. Japan's sphere had successfully been carved out of the ashes of World War 2 and Europe developed its own bloc, as the U.S and the Soviets developed a closer friendship. As the World reaches into the 2020s, unprecedented and incredible progress in AI and robotics has made the nature of human existence evermore artificial, and often finds itself at odds with its roots. As Africa builds its national identities, the global north reaches the Twilight of the Anthropocene. What shall be the future of humanity in God's Golfball?"
BIA_TOTA_DESC:0 "Once Nigeria passed the Second World War, new technologies allowed the discovery of immense amounts of oil in Eastern Nigeria. As it turns out however, the Igbo people in the southeast of the country had not received any kind of trickling down of wealth from Yoruba peoples, who maintained most of the oil companies alongside foreign investors. Thus, Biafra had seceded right after Nigerian independence and managed to score an incredible victory, against all odds, in its fight against Lagos. As it turns out, Nigeria was not happy to lose most of its oil supplies after the humiliating peace treaty (which included the independence of the Republic of Benin) and invaded four more times to try and secure the area, the latest war being ongoing. The fate of this wealthy and developing country, then, hangs in the balance..."

ISP_TOTA_DESC: "Winning its independence in a war against all its neighbors following the chaotic departure of the British mandate in 1947, the Hebrew Republic has fulfilled the dream of building a national home for the Jewish people in Eretz YIsrael.\nQuickly aligning itself with the Soviet Union, the Labour Zionist government of Yitzhak Tabenkin managed to secure much needed support for the settlement of the devastated remains of the Eastern European Jewish community, and centralizing power, unifying all socialist parties under the banner of Mapam (the United Workers Party), subjugating others to a singular National Front, and finally declaring the establishment of a Socialist Republic of Labour in 1951. Since then the Hebrew Republic has repelled the Arab armies surrounding it many times, expanding far beyond the borders of 47, annexing some lands under the nationalist line of Tabenkin, and returning others in an ongoing process of peace. The Hebrew Republic of Labour stands proud, having established itself as a major force in the Middle East, and yet its future is still uncertain. As inner tensions and factionalism grow between the establishment and reformists who seek to root out their perceived decay and corruption, between those who seek to maintain and uphold the Jewish character of the state and those who seek to move beyond the zionist vision, old enemies are rising from their decades long slumber, as anti Zionist movements opposed to the Soviet World Order Eber is representing are regaining traction and planning their next move."
POLITICS_OMOREGIE_OGBEIDE_DESC: "A native of Benin City, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama was given privileged access to the country's education center, often touted as one of the best universities in the Bight of Benin (aside from the French universities). Quickly picking up an interest in engineering and management, Omoregie meteorically gained ground through his early investment into petroleum extraction studies and a master's thesis on extraction of minerals. With this background, Omoregie decided to get into politics at the behest of the Technocracy Party of Benin, which gained a surprise victory in the 2019 election and has since been managing the country through a strange mix of liberalism, technocracy and managerialism. Cited as one of Africa's biggest champions of the "French model", Omoregie wishes to create more rational and clean government through campaigning for the ideals of technocracy all over West Africa, but these lofty ambitions are somewhat stalled by the realities of Biafran and Nigerian conflict..."

SPICER_DESC_SUC: "Tim Spicer is known for truly living the "fortune" in soldier of fortune. He is known for his high living, forgoing the messier jobs that would see his command trudging miles of empty savannah, desert, or forest, instead preferring to engage those in need of top-line private security. Though decried by critics as a "feet-up General", his intense pursuit and embracing of cutting-edge technology have afforded him some prestige due to the comfortable and safe lives his command are able to live out. There is no doubt that this will translate to his policy should he come to be Moneta's successor.\n\nIdeology: £technocracy_texticon Managerial Bureaucracy"

VIKTOR_DESC_SUC: "A relative up-and-comer, Viktor Bout is most respected for his extraordinary talent in diplomacy rather than his military experience. A polyglot since his youth in the Soviet Union, Bout has amassed a colossal number of connections worldwide that brought him into the arms-dealing industry. Rather uniquely among Seychellois mercenaries, he has kept his socialist perspective throughout his years of trading. Supported by civilians and military personnel alike, Bout holds lofty ideals for Seychelles. Not only does he favour wealth redistribution, advocating for a more hands-off approach to the Soviet Market System, but he also seeks to create the first "post-national" identity, promoting the archipelago as the first truly global society, and pushing for the adoption of Esperanto as the primary diplomatic lingua franca.\n\nIdeology: £reformist_socialism_texticon Soviet Market System"

PRINCE_DESC_SUC: "A controversial figure among Seychelles' high-profile elite, Erik Prince is well acquainted with scorn and admiration alike. A strong believer in ends justifying means, Prince has been followed for much of his career by various rumours and accusations - war crimes, atrocities, and undue civilian deaths - but nothing has ever stuck. He has also never been quiet about his own personal politics, wishing to change the focus of Seychelles' global army to that of anti-communist pursuits, staging interventions in various left-wing nations or against left-wing insurgents.\n\nIdeology: £autocracy_texticon Military Governance"

BARLOW_DESC_SUC: "One of the most senior Seychellois figures, Barlow is known best for his activities in Africa fighting in many of the wars and exploits that plagued the continent when the Europeans left. Fighting in the Congo, in Biafra, in Sudan, and more, the native South African best exemplifies the comaraderie and honor of mercenary life, ensuring contracts are duly followed through, that payment is received, and that representatives of the global army are brought to justice when required. This coincides with his ambitions to reform the Seychellois state apparatus to enhance its legitimacy, clarifying the various divides - economic, political, civic - between mercenary and civilian life on the archipelago.\n\nIdeology: £autocracy_texticon Anocratic Liberalism"
