economy_type: "Economy Type"
kosygin_liberman_econ_theory: "Kosygin-Liberman Economic Model"
kosygin_liberman_econ_theory_desc: "Emerging from the overwhelming success of the Kosygin-Liberman reforms and its later adaptation to the implementation of OGAS within the Soviet Union, The Kosygin-Liberman Economic Model is a mixture between centralized economic planning and limited market autonomy. The core defining aspect of the KLEM is its reliance on a complex series of algorithms, often falling into the category of an “Artificial General Intelligence'', designed to streamline and standardize the productivity of the various sectors of the economy. Alongside the reliance on this AGI, the economy is split into public sector government ventures, with these ventures operating within the bounds of a private firm, and joint ventures between private citizens and public officials in a state-owned enterprise."
cologne_capitalism: "Cologne Capitalism"
cologne_capitalism_desc: "Developed after the end of the Second World War, Cologne Capitalism is a form of a free market economy in which coordination between various corporations and government agencies acts as a way to procure large scale benefits for public citizens across the country. A defining aspect of this model is its tolerance and often encouragement of large-scale monopolies over the economy, citing them as preferable in achieving these goals. The intended purpose of this is to make collective bargaining and other disruptive forms of worker organizing sidelined in favor of government intervention to achieve state-mandated social policies such as universal healthcare coverage and subsidized education as a byproduct of the large earnings achieved by these megacorporations."
bogji_model: "Bogji Model"
bogji_model_desc: "Following the independence of the Korean People’s Republic and sudden subservience under the Japanese Empire, the Bogji Model is a fundamentally strange and hybridized development. Through decentrally organized local councils, worker cooperatives, credit unions, and privately operated businesses, a patchwork of planned conglomerates emerge, acting as private entities on the world stage. These patchworks, called “Ibuls” or quilts, operate on behalf of their workers and consumers, using their gains to provide social benefits and promote “democracy” within their workplaces, while subtly following Japanese inspired methods of managerial efficiency and control."
mitsubishi_managerialism: "Mitsubishi Managerial Model"
mitsubishi_managerialism_desc: "Like many things across the Japanese sphere of influence, their economic model is not easy to explain to foreign observers and analysts at first. Incorporating elements of scientific managerialism in every aspect of the workplace and appling corporatist organization principles through Zaibatsus, the MMM strives for efficiency, growth, and quality above all else. Taking these core values into hand, economies following this model treat it more like a religion or way of life than a conventional economic system."
beijing_new_course: "Beijing New Course"
beijing_new_course_desc: "As maoist China leaped into the 21st century, so did its economy, becoming the defining standpoint for non-market oriented socialists and command economies globally, Beijing New Course as a model has been only defined by what it isn’t. It vehemently opposes any form of market intrusion into its view and choses to stick along lines of placing the interests of the dictatorship of the proletariat first. While it does not dislike cybernetic planning, it is often slower to adopt and implement it compared to its contemporaries. In many cases, Beijing New Course is a vestigial organ in the various economic schools of thought of this new world order."
portlandian_gift_economy: "Portlandian Gift Economy"
portlandian_gift_economy_desc: "Less of an economic system or model, and more of a guideline for social behavior and association, Portlandian Gift Economy refers to a tendency of decentralized yet planned economies that have emerged among anarchist and anti-authoritarian tendencies across the world, growing in support following the 2008 recession. Portlandian Gift Economies often employ methods of mutual aid, altruism, general consensus and other collectively beneficial methods of decision making and cooperation over economic factors such as profit or growth."
anarchist_capitalism: "Anarchist Capitalism"
anarchist_capitalism_desc: "Both an economic model and a political viewpoint, Anarchist Capitalism, often referred to by its voluntary adherents and supporters as Anarcho-Capitalism is an economic framework defined by two core principles, the maximization of the free market and the minimization of state interference in it. Anarchist Capitalism often appears in two forms, the first being intentional Anarcho-Capitalism carried out by its followers, in which the state apparatus has either been severely diminished or abolished and in which private enterprise has been given full control over its duties amongst their ordinary afars. The other form is unintentional Capitalist Anarchy, found often in underdeveloped and highly destabilized regions, in which warlords and other powerful cartels dominate the economy through exploitative and amoral means. The difference between the two variants is slim at best."
lawlessness: "Lawlessness"
lawlessness_desc: "Be it the clear lack of organized and legal economic activity, a collapse in economic mechanisms and institutions, or a deliberate choice to forgo economics at all, Lawlessness is characterized by its clear lack of structure and stability. Often in lawless “economies”, black and gray markets are widespread, criminal syndicates and/or tribal bands control most forms of production and distribution of various goods and services, with scavenging and acts of violence being means of exchanging ownership of the means of production."
national_salvation_model: "National Salvation Model"
national_salvation_model_desc: "The byproduct of post-war political theorists and military strategists in Austro-Bavaria rather than conventional economists, the National Salvation Model is an unusual and heterodoxical approach to economics overall. Prioritizing the nation above any other factor or principle, the NSM derives itself from corporatist, guild socialist, right-wing syndicalist, and other reactionary schools of economic thought in practice. NSM attempts to subdue the economy in service of the nation, through the usage of heavy government intervention and the interloping of highly politicized institutions into business ventures, occasionally taking pages out of the MMM in its use of managerialist and algocratic elements."
anglo_saxon_model: "Anglo-Saxon Model"
anglo_saxon_model_desc: "As a result of the dominance of the Labour Party in British Politics, the Anglo-Saxon model is one of the defining forefronts of social democracy across the anglosphere and beyond. Centering the lower classes in mind, through the usage of predictive planning models, often taught via a vast surveillance apparatus operated either directly by the government or indirectly through private enterprises, the ASM attempts to raise the general living conditions and happiness of its core demographic through what could be described as “predeterministic state socialism”."
phoenix_model: "Phoenix School"
phoenix_model_desc: "Developing under the aegis of Arizona governor Kirsten Sinema in the 2010s, the model’s name has a dual meaning, as its proponents herald it as the rebirth of laissez-faire economics in America and abroad. The Phoenix School utilizes a rather vague suite of artificial intelligence tools in order to overcome the failings of the Chicago School and other early free market systems while maintaining a commitment to avoiding any perceived authoritarianism."
post_recession_exceptionalism: "Post-Recession Exceptionalism"
post_recession_exceptionalism_desc: "Following the Buchanan administration, and intensified under the Obama administration, American fiscal policy has been nothing short of “exceptional”. Exceptionally stupid in its various executions, exceptionally incoherent in its direct applications, exceptionally great at confusing the average American, and exceptionally ineffective at recovering from the crash of 2008. With no clear sign of recovery from the recession, yet some signs of economic growth, the American economic “model” is defined by either its adherence to free market capitalism, a love-hate relationship with big business, and frequently changing social policies. Unless things change greatly, the American economic “model” will stay, for the worse."
nouveau_dirigisme: "Nouveau Dirigisme"
nouveau_dirigisme_desc: "Just as the Gaullist regime secured its foothold over France and its sphere of influence, it had done so over the economy. However, the model of Nouveau Dirigisme is a unique occurrence among authoritarian regimes. Rather than using direct economic intervention, Nouveau Dirigisme relies more on indirect policies to influence and control the economy such as taxation of firms based on performance and subsidization of large-scale research projects. This has led to the creation of not a command economy but rather an "economy of expectations"."
