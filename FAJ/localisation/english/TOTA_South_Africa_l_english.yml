Most were outside, but many were listening in on their phones or just by trying to be as close to the room as possible.\nThere had been murmurs and fears of a government crackdown on the native population in response to the increasing unrest. Without a doubt it’d be front page news, no matter what the NP said, all the more reason to be here anyways.\nBeing first up to get the scoop on something like this would be the best thing to have happened to him in quite a long time indeed..."

That is, until one of the speakers on stage began to say:\n“The accusations of bias in government policy and coercion over the Eastern Bantustans over rationing and the redirecting of water are wholly baseless. That Pretoria was unaffected by this policy is not due to any bias, and we strongly condemn such blatant attempts at sowing unrest and anger at the government.\nDespite the clearly fabricated nature of these baseless allegations, riots in the provinces of Transkei, Ciskei and KwaZulu continue to grow in intensity. Let us be clear, we have nothing but goodwill to those natives who seek cooperation with the government. As such, we have decided to allow some compromise with Native groups who seek peaceful change and dialogue. This compromise involves the expansion of the privileges of coloured and black folk within the Apartheid system as some of its more conservative aspects shall be tweaked and changed.\nHowever, we have no tolerance for violence and movements who seek to achieve their aims by violent means. Therefore, in reaction to the riots in the Bantustans which seek to annihilate South African stability and subvert the constitution of South Africa, we will be supporting the mentioned Bantustans through supplying Boston Dynamics Spot and Rex units to help suppress the riots, by force if necessary.” \nOne of the Afrikaner MPs, despite his age, began booing the Speaker, slamming the table in anger and shouting after;\n“You have DESTROYED this country! First all this LGBTQAIP alphabet soup bullshit and now we deal with the Negro horde destroying ourselves as an outpost of European civilization?”\nA Colored MP near the Afrikaner legislator, part of the African National Congress, heaved a deep slap against the geriatric’s head, causing him to lose balance and fall unto the ground. Chaos ensued, with dozens of parliamentarians blaming one another and the Colored MP getting heavy punches thrown against him, causing him to lose a tooth and cough blood. Others stepped in to try to defend him as the room melted into a sea of shouting, and kicking. Dozens others begin taking items and props from the building to aggress their fellow countrymen.\n\nNot one for fighting, Athol felt his mouth dry up, ducking and weaving through the maelstrom of violence. He seeped out through the door while the braver journalists in the area were still registering the commotion.

It made no sense to simply throw around water like nobody's business - it had to be properly rationed and distributed - and Gazali knew that.\n\nBefore drawing the short straw on having to make the announcement, they'd been put in charge of detailing out the policy across the City, through press conferences and such. This was mostly, relatively safe, but the harassment always manages to find a way.\n\n"For fuck's sake", said Gazali. "Do they really need to spray my fucking walls with this shit?"\n\nThe left side of their house had been smattered with all manner of queerphobic slurs, but seeing "Hairyback" up there told Gazali what they needed to know.

As police cordoned off the highway, the verdant grasslands which covered the Witwatersrand vista disappeared into the concrete jungles of Pretoria. The pickets and complaints slowly disappeared and Manuel found himself within the most affluent exclave of Afrikaner culture in the whole Highveld.\n\nSoon he spotted the Driekeleur flowing against the wind, its proud colors shining against the sweltering sun.\n\n"This is the place?", he said, as the car slowed down.\n"Indeed," said his chaffeur in a soft tone, rolling down the bulletproof windows of the car.\nForemost was the Federal Capital of South Africa. Not once had Trevor stepped within, mostly relegated to a Cape Town mayorship. He walked in graciously, guided by a freckled Boer lady at the door.\nAfter ceremonialisms and formal greetings, Manuel found himself face to face with an aging, weak F.W De Klerk and Andries Breytenbach, not looking much better, contrasted with the energetic Trevor Manuel.\n\n"We'd like to hand out to the ANC, particularly its moderate and rational elements, despite parsimony from our reactionary peers, a hand in negotiating and securing a better future for South African citizens in general and the reorganization of our political structure," said De Klerk, smiling a little.\n\n"Yes? Please say in plain English what you want from me, exactly, please." Trevor retorted, assertive.\n"We don't want something from you. We want to give something to you; the halls to real Coloured empowerement."\n\nTrevor, despite his sky-blue eyes and fair skin, had been classified as a Cape Coloured for his entire life and this had suddenly picked up his otherwise cynical heart, rekindled with an utopian tenderness.\n"What are your terms?", asked Trevor, wondering what kind of terrible concessions the ANC would have to provide, worried of another purge within the party."

Yet, in South Africa, social fascists, neoliberals and more kept the country on chokehold in favor of white supremacy and kleptocracy.\n\nJulius Malema had been arduously mashing hitpiece after hitpiece against the "spineless" South African Communist Party, and all its pointlessness sunk on him after a few days of deliberation in South Africa's first popular election in its history. The South African Communist Party had won out, and, more importantly, Malema was hinted at being put on trial for alleged warcrimes in Orania.\nIn fact, it had been such a concern to him that he had prepared - and indeed, executed partially - plans to barricade his Masakeng home. Guns, artillery, and an entire regiment was holed up in the Seshego suburb.\n\nDays would pass by and it seemed the government simply wouldn't arrive to take Malema to trial. Was it perhaps a sign of a deal..?\nMalema, increasingly relaxed, was shopping in Cambridge Foods as he looked towards a bag of screws in the utility section - but by the time he'd grab them, his head was plunged against the cabinet, dragged slowly and painfully towards the sweltering street."

This would be the topic of today's session. The first man to speak was James Williams, representing a wealthy part of Cape Town. He advocated the use of English as the federal government's sole official language, arguing that it would simplify the bureaucratic system and pointing out that it was the language of that very discussion. The next man to speak did so in Afrikaans, seemingly to spite Mr. Williams. He advocated the sole use of Afrikaans, much to the chagrin of most of the other MPs. His argument was that Zuid-Afrika needed its own unique language. A Zulu MP interrupted him, pointing out that the Black languages were also unique to South Africa and suggesting that all the major languages be official, as to have them stand on equal footing. An Indian MP began to recite a carefully crafted speech stressing the importance of the Tamil language, only to be interrupted by a Coloured man promoting that some moribund Khoisan language be added to the list.

At least thats how the thing was supposed to go. In reality of course about half of the cases were fabricated. For some time, crime really went down, but now it seemed like it was just morphed with the very thing that was initiated to stop it.\n\nUntil the day that every phone and laptop could get the message that from this day, the military should step down and allow the local civilian administration to take the helms of management. For a time everyone thought that life would return to peaceful stability, but then half of MP personel were to be officially enlisted in regular police, smiles quickly withered away. And when another rumor confirmed itself true, that the head of military administration was to be the leader of police department, all quickly frowned and gritted their teeth. Very soon they would learn that they aren't the only ones to face this administrative calamity. Soon those towns were filled with rioting people, with the mess equal to the fights of recent civil war taking place. In the end, the government had to move itself and change everything.

SAF_breakthrough_in_the_orange_river_desc: "The AWB and their bunch of far right freaks have been defeated, but their extermination ought to be our priority now. They may not be as numerous as the ANC or Separatists, but they do have a lot of weapons and strings within some parts of our government, which they may use should we drag on our war for too long. We beat them in 1900 and have beat them again."
SAF_breakthrough_in_the_tugela: "Breakthrough in the Tugela"
SAF_breakthrough_in_the_tugela_desc: "And so, Tugela Falls falls. Before us is the final road towards the victory agaisnt the black radicals that wished to turn everything upside down. They may not be as experienced and armed as the Boers, but they easily compensate that in stubborness and numbers, and unless put to rest, can spread out throughout the nation and agitate the black majority towarda a revolt. Now, better to dead the red."
SAF_breakthrough_in_ovamboland: "Breakthrough in Ovamboland"
SAF_breakthrough_in_ovamboland_desc: "The Separatists are cornered, they have nowhere else to run as on three sides they are surrounded by other states, and on the fourth one stands our army. Entertaining themselves with the idea of a state once created by German imperialists, they shall face a harsh reality that our republic does not tolerates when someone wants to break away."
SAF_help_our_klerksdorpers: "Help Our Rustenburgers"
SAF_help_our_klerksdorpers_desc: "Our main advantage is that we control most of the country and the coast, giving us access to the international waters, but a large group of our forces have been locked in the north and are pressed to the borders from all sides. If we manage to reach them, we can split our enemies in two, isolating and dealing with them one by one."
SAF_airdrop_supplies: "Airdrop Supplies"
SAF_airdrop_supplies_desc: "Most of the airforces remained with us, and with the sky under our firm control, we shall drop supplies and reinforcements over Klerksdorp to help our boys. As they force our enemies to pull more and more from the south, we may have a sound possibility of making a breakthrough."
SAF_the_northern_cape_strategy: "The Northern Cape Strategy"
SAF_the_northern_cape_strategy_desc: "After careful considerations, it has been decided by the general staff that our attacks should be focused on the North, against the enclave of BRF on the borders with Botswana. Separated from their comrades in the south, they wont pose much threat to our armored spearhead."
SAF_the_bloemfontein_strategy: "The Bloemfontein Strategy"
SAF_the_bloemfontein_strategy_desc: "After careful considerations, it has been decided by the general staff that our attacks should be focused in the center of the frontline against the Boers. While risky, if implemented properly we can deliver a string of defeats against those racist freaks, considerably weakening their positions in the future."
SAF_hold_off_white_flight: "Hold Off White Flight"
SAF_hold_off_white_flight_desc: "What those bastards know, is that its better to flee when you are at the losing end of the game. And why not, a lot of those traitors have connections all over Europe and Asia, some of them even being in the pockets of their corporations and politicians. Some dont, but this doesnt changes the situation, they must be stopped and brought to justice, so first and foremost, we shall cover them with our airforce like a glass covers the insect before it is crushed."
SAF_reassure_our_pioneers: "Reassure Our Pioneers"
SAF_reassure_our_pioneers_desc: "What those bastards know, is that its better to flee when you are at the losing end of the game. And we understand their concerns, however, if we are to build a stable state in the future, we shall not fall into black and white worldview. If we put them down, we shall earn only hate from the wider Boer population, and like a century ago, earn a second Vietnam on our asses. That is of course, unless some of them agree to lay down arms, they dont have anywhere to run anyway."
SAF_dismantle_the_anc_gang: "Dismantle the ANC Gang"
SAF_dismantle_the_anc_gang_desc: "BRF is a wide collection of far left parties, but the chief amongst them is the African National Congress. While it may have fallen out of grace, but it has remained the most dangerous entity to our government. As it still has popular appeal within black youth, using them as an underground resistance. Even worse, out of all the others, it exists within the legal framework, making it difficult to disband it. In peace time, which does not applies to the current situation."
SAF_clean_up_durban: "Clean Up Durban"
SAF_clean_up_durban_desc: "Of all cities that fell to anarchy, Durban became the center of BRF activity. For more than a decade this region was a giant pain for us, and now it has concentrated in itself the most "revolutionary" and unhinged opposition politicians, and being the center for BRF economic, political and military power. If we are to restore order, then we must smoke out every single one of them, if needed-demolish the whole city. Better to be overcautious when handling such garbage."
SAF_wipe_out_terrorists: "Wipe Out Terrorists"
SAF_wipe_out_terrorists_desc: "When dealing with fanatics, we must always be vigilant. They may have lost the battle and the war, but such formalities would not stop them. As we advance, behind our backs BRF operates with a network of underground cells that are dealing even more damage than their frontline troops, hiding in our nation's lush forests and caves. Luckily for us, on our sides are drones, police and aircraft. If they wish to fight us everywhere, we shall fight them everywhere, and if we catch them, no matter where, even if in toilet-then we shall drown them right there."
SAF_expand_the_bantustans: "Expand the Homelands"
SAF_expand_the_bantustans_desc: "Perhaps keeping them all on a tight leash wasnt the best decision either. Our north is distinct in the fact that it has a way higher diversity of languages and identities than our south, and its simply too difficult to manage them all in centralist fashion for the time being. Maybe later they can become more normal, yet now its better if we leave them alone, of course within our state."
SAF_and_give_them_more_rights: "And Give Them More Rights!"
SAF_and_give_them_more_rights_desc: "We dont really care what they may do inside their borders, its better off if we dont get the headache of trying to manage them at all. Those people suffered from our centralisation for a bit too long, now, let them breathe at least somewhat more freely. Those regions will get their own language schools, economic rights, maybe even different judicial system, if that keeps them loyal."
SAF_protect_their_sovereignity: "Protect Their Sovereignity!"
SAF_protect_their_sovereignity_desc: "Whatever they may do, its best if they at least acknowledge our rule over them. And for that its best that we guard them from all those who want to remove their existence. Pan africanists who believe that those tribal distinctions are too archaic, bureaucrats who believe the country should be one, and racists who just want them gone. So, if someone dares to touch them, it is our duty to slap their hands."
SAF_a_slow_integration_into_society: "A Slow Integration Into Society"
SAF_a_slow_integration_into_society_desc: "And while we give them liberties, they must understand that we dont do so out of kindness, but as a means to end disorder. Now that they have their long desired autonomy, they must do their part as well, and establish firm and constant contacts with Pretoria. Additionally, since they have their autonomy, it is now their concern on how to integrate properly, so, let us just push them lightly in the right direction should something go wrong."
SAF_punish_those_responsible: "Punish Those Responsible"
SAF_punish_those_responsible_desc: "Right now, we are in dire need of public approval, and it so happens that the majority of our public is black. And what a luck, we have many officials of the Boers right in our hands, from pencil pushers to the military staff. By organizing show trials of every single one of them, compared to trials over the Nazis, with some pathos and drama thrown in, we can raise our ratings through the roof. Besides, we dont even need to make true accusations all the time, the louder their accused crime, the better it is for the image of our justice."
SAF_unite_against_majoritarianism: "Unite Against Majoritarianism"
SAF_unite_against_majoritarianism_desc: "There is a clear difference when it comes to democracy and pure anarchy caused by the wants of the mob rule. And right now, we are approaching that chaos as everyone cheers for execution of every Boer that exists. We abide the laws and the laws dont care for your feelings, those who were captured as POWs, laid down their arms and agreed to cooperate with us shall be treated according to the law, and not by the will of those who couldnt even vote yesterday."
SAF_south_africa_is_white: "South Africa is White"
SAF_south_africa_is_white_desc: "Whatever someone says, our history begins not with tribes, but the Dutch and British settlers arriving here. Before them, there was nothing, and even less than that. All of the great things, all the skyscrapers, economy, army and even the state that now protects us was built by the white people. South Africa is a white nation, always was and will be, and we are proud of acknowledging the basic facts of history, not polluted by emotions and wishful thinking of the radicals."
SAF_south_africa_is_a_rainbow: "South Africa is a Rainbow"
SAF_south_africa_is_a_rainbow_desc: "We are a nation that exists only thanks to the voluntary cooperation and unity of all that inhabit it. And those are not just the whites, but the countless tribes and ethnicities that inhabit the borders of our nation. From Namibia to the Cape, on both shores our cities could be described only as melting pots, where people of all stripes and colors come together to build a better future. South Africa is not a white nation, nor is it a black one, it is a rainbow nation where every color is present and every color is equal to the others."
SAF_an_unique_cultural_identity: "A Unique Cultural Identity"
SAF_an_unique_cultural_identity_desc: "Whatever South Africa is, it is first and foremost an entity that was created as a child of colonial experiments. When the British left, we were left with the question that every being asks itself "What am I?". Part of why the civil war happened, is that we lacked unity in identity, with everyone identifying themselves whatever comes to mind, as long as it is distinct enough from someone else. And whats the root of the problem? All this division existed on the basis of race, and if we are to build a stable country, we are better to answer this question sooner rather than later."
SAF_put_a_bandaid_over_it: "Put A Bandaid Over It"
SAF_put_a_bandaid_over_it_desc: "If we truly want this war to end, then it is better to talk than fight. BRF may be cornered, but like anyone in this situation, they will fight to the last, potentially dragging this whole mess to eternity and beyond. Not all of them wish to destroy our Republic, and we may have some common points on a few issues. Let us extend them a hand, and if they accept to shake it, then we shall find a compromise, one way or another."
SAF_rub_alcohol_on_the_wound: "Rub Alcohol On The Wound"
SAF_rub_alcohol_on_the_wound_desc: "The only way to deal BRF a final blow is to finish their whole cabal in one final stroke. By making a throughout operation to hunt down their leaders, find their armories and getting as much info as possible through their captives, we shall erase this excuse of "liberators" from history. Their leaders shall be put on trial and every single one of their members shall serve a harsh penalty they deserve for all the sufferings they brought."
SAF_misson_accomplished: "Misson Accomplished"
SAF_mission_accomplished_desc: "The last gunshots were heard a few days ago. There are only scarce reports of individual and isolated resistance in the faraway countryside. So far, combat has been reduced to occasional standoffs between our forces and some lost militias, most of them prefer to surrender. Military administration has been established pretty much everywhere and law slowly returns as well. Border patrols also show that any contraband or crossings are kept in check. While its clear that its just a calm before something greater but, for now we can say that our mission of making our nation whole has been accomplished. Not as smooth as we wanted, but even that is better than nothing."
SAF_now_leaving_frownland: "Now Leaving: Frownland"
SAF_now_leaving_frownland_desc: "Our way was full of thorns, in fact that would be a great underestimation, our way here was an absolute hell of a fight. The country certainly never experienced such terrible things since Boer Wars. However, lamenting for what happened wouldnt get us anywhere, cities still lay in ruins, racial disputes are still present, the economy...better not to mention that. We must either fix the issues that led to the war in the first place, or the future generations will never forgive us for not giving them a chance to live a happy life. Its either now or never, come aboard our train of progress, we are now leaving: Frownland. Our next stop-South Africa for all!"
SAF_step_back_from_the_rubicon: "Step Back From The Rubicon"
SAF_step_back_from_the_rubicon_desc: "Right now the best thing to do is to curb that absolute power we gave ourselves. It was more than usefull during the war, but now that legitimacy of emergency is gone. The complicated part is that we still have many problems to deal with on all fronts from all sides, but restoring the trust of the general populace would be a smart move. At least they will feel more comfortable reporting their problems to the good old bureaucrats in suit and tie, rather than the gloomy officers."
SAF_disarm_the_mines: "Disarm The Mines"
SAF_disarm_the_mines_desc: "When the war began, our army planted a plethora of minefields throughout the country. And even more throughout the war. Many of our defense strategies tried to predict the enemy's movements, and while many of such devices helped our cause, we get reports that people cant walk out of their house without losing at least one of their limbs.  Warfare may be over, but there shall be no rest for the army until every device would be disarmed and put back to the warehouse where they will be stored for a better use against an actual enemy."
SAF_undo_the_barricades: "Undo The Barricades"
SAF_undo_the_barricades_desc: "Urban fights, whether they be in Capetown or Windhoek turned out to be less than pleasant. We werent the only one who fell for this sin, but still, many of the roads are blocked with rubbish and ruins which were used to build fortifications. Even in the areas where no intense fights happened barricades are still present on the streets, set up by the Military Police and the Army units. But since there is no shootings, at least, intense ones-we shall slowly remove them so the urban activity may resume once more."
SAF_clear_out_the_barracks: "Clear Out The Barracks"
SAF_clear_out_the_barracks_desc: "As the war raged on, we had many casualties and those needed to somehow  get replaced. The only solution that we had was conscription and massive complex of agressive propaganda, as well as switching entire economy to the war efforts. This has created a large surplus for us in manpower and ammunition, but right now many simply dont see the reason to see recruitment posts and propaganda loudspeakers at every corner. Its best to remove all of those, giving the people a sense of peace and reduce already high stress factor."
SAF_your_children_back_home: "Your Children Back Home"
SAF_your_children_back_home_desc: "True, many young men died for our cause of preserving the nation, but those that survived are heroes of it and no one will be forgotten. However, many mothers, wives and relatives expect to see their children back home. It is simply a too heavy burden on our already thin finances to keep all those men in the army. Demobilization will ensure that reunions of long separated people will calm everyone down, and allow us to concentrate on more pressing matters."
SAF_referendum_on_apartheid: "Referendum On Apartheid"
SAF_referendum_on_apartheid_desc: "We had plans to end this racial-based institute even before the war, but the situation got out of control much quicker and bloodier than we expected. Now its time to finally end it through the will of the people. Many whites have fought with blacks in this war, shoulder to shoulder. Many stereotypes that haunted our colored population dissapeared under the many cases of firm friendship between races within the units. We can say with a foregone conclusion that the curse set upon us by Malan will be undone."
SAF_a_nation_breathes_once_more: "A Nation Breathes Once More"
SAF_a_nation_breathes_once_more_desc: "Inheriting the democratic traditions of United Kingdom, South Africa, despite many of its flaws survived through the 20th century as the only truly stable democracy on the continent, without any coups, crushing crisis or anything else. During wartime many of those liberties had to be supressed for obvious reasons but now let us open ourselves to Liberty once more. Deregulate the press, allow the meetings, restore civilian government and institutions. "
SAF_deflate_the_army: "Deflate The Army"
SAF_deflate_the_army_desc: "While technology is a key factor to victory, quantity cannot be thrown away. Sadly, we had to partially rely on quantity, now leaving us with mountains of guns thrown around and no butter on the plate. When drafting a new budget, we will have to seriously deflate the army size, sell some of our stocks and even send many into forced retirement. Cruel? Yes, but until we can rest assured that we are standing on solid foundations, we have to make sacrifices."
SAF_open_up_to_parties: "Open Up To Parties"
SAF_open_up_to_parties_desc: "Although elections may not come any time soon, its better to start solid preparations now than late. For the sake of national stability, all parties were forcefully disbanded in order to maintain ideological purity, but if we seriously want to legitimize our claims for democratic South Africa, then it is best to pair our words with some action. Another side benefit for us would be the fact that we can decide who will receive priority during legalization process."
SAF_the_language_debate: "The Language Debate"
SAF_the_language_debate_desc: "During establishment of our nation, English was the only language of the state, and only later reforms allowed Afrikaan to exist. However, while most of our population speaks on either of those 2, there are still many more that speak their own native languages, and even more young Africans now seek to their cultural past. Unless we solve the issue by giving them their desires, we may never be sure that the nation wont face another disaster in the future."
SAF_define_our_communities: "Define Our Communities"
SAF_define_our_communities_desc: "Most of the world still sees Africa as one indistinguishable single nationality which is fundamentally wrong. Europeans, Boers, Bantu, Ovambo, Herero, Khoisan and many others are their own people with different traditions, customs and languages. Of course all of them are listed as South Africans in their passports, that does not reflects the reality of our immense diversity. Many people overseas nicknamed us the Rainbow Nation for our multitude of peoples, let us embrace this title!"

SAF_chin_up_and_the_sun_in_our_faces_desc: "Life returns to normalcy. People walk to their job, from their job, shop around and talk of the future that awaits them. Some fled to see their close ones or find a better opportunity but we can say for sure that the chaos is over. That is however, not to be confused with the dark realities that lay behind the curtains of stabilization. Many outside of our cities still live in such conditions that can be considered only as dangerous. Many pre-war freedoms and luxuries are still unavailable, the economy continues to be in a freefall and even on the world stage many doubt we can hold out for more than few years at best. That is not to be considered as a sign that we shall surrender, far from it. We shall make one final push to tear through this darkness to build the nation back stronger, richer and more fair than ever!"

SAF_restoring_the_economy: "Restoring The Economy"
SAF_restoring_the_economy_desc: "Being one of the richest countries on the continent, South Africa has fell down to the rank of the most downtrodden in all aspects from HDI to education. Businesses were shut down, factories either lay empty, collapsed or mobilized for the war. Roads are still broken with only the army trucks able to traverse through the rough terrain. Foreign investors are all but gone. Stocks values are falling with every second as we speak. There is no more deep than that. Which gives us an ample opportunity to rebuild everything in our own image. Throw away the rifle, grab the shovel, there is a lot of work to do."
SAF_democratize_the_businesses: "Democratize The Businesses"
SAF_democratize_the_businesses_desc: "While far-left radicals may preach of how horrible capitalism is, it certainly needs some fixing. A lot of our pre-war conglomerates were closed-off structures with offshores and hierarchies that were not just confusing but also racially motivated and almost monopolizing our economy to the point of pushing down any initiative from non-whites. Some breakups here, strategic cuts there and a few bailouts paired with new laws requiring transparency in finances and employment, as well as anti-trust laws will ensure that South African business will be regarded as fair and equitable business."
SAF_chat_with_the_imf: "Chat With The IMF"
SAF_chat_with_the_imf_desc: "The thing is: We are broke, and thats to put it simply. In a more complex explanation: We are running on borrowed time which is no longer than a few months. To bring back some life into our nation, we need money, fast, preferably right now. Private banks are too scared of investing, and global superpowers are even more sceptical. Our only choice is the IMF. We shall apply for several loans and reconstruction programms that follow. Of course some positions will have to be surrendered and some concessions made, but that is better than facing a total economic breakdown."
SAF_talk_with_the_experts: "Talk With The Experts"
SAF_talk_with_the_experts_desc: "Right now we need actions, but throwing around money will not fix the problem. Especially considering that we dont have that much of them in the first place. Our actions must be properly directed and rationalized, and that requires placing priorities on what is to be fixed right now, how and what to do next. Assembling our best national and foreign experts from all over the world will bring us many viewpoints on how to end the crisis, and while disagreements may ensue, in the end-we will turn to a healthy compromise."
SAF_new_cities_across_the_nation: "New Cities Across The Nation"
SAF_new_cities_across_the_nation_desc: "Many cities within our nation are overpopulated. This brings in many problems as there is simply not enough jobs, water, food and shelter for everyone. Luckily, we have a lot of space, and a lot of cheap workforce going around aimlessly. Contacting multiple consturction firms, giving them land and those unemployed would give us unthinkable results in the future as countless jobs will restore our purchase power and new sites would be perfect for opening up new business."
SAF_antiracism_codified: "Anti-Racism Codified"
SAF_antiracism_codified_desc: "Laws may do much, but on the individual level the racist attitudes of many citizens are still present. Not only does this harms our stability but also economy as many are simply left out of the economic life by prejudice, blocking their way to education and self-development as active members of society. Anti-racist laws, propaganda, marches of solidarity-all of those should bring the feeling of brotherhood and if necessary-curb those that discriminate against one another because of their skin, rather than their character."
SAF_print_borrow_beg: "Print, Borrow, Beg"
SAF_print_borrow_beg_desc: "Even with the foreign loans and economic stability restored, we lack funds to make the Invisible Hand do anything. Therefore, we must embrace the unthinkable. Turn on the printing press, start filling the gaps quickly. Ask for neighbours, Europe, Asia, America, Russia, anyone for another small loan. Beg for investors to return because unless we fill the demands, all of what we have done will be in vain. Besides, there is nothing wrong with spending? The more we spend on our people, the more we will get in return, right? Right?"
SAF_efficiency_over_rancor: "Efficiency Over Rancor"
SAF_efficiency_over_rancor_desc: "Many within our borders still think that Africans are unskilled and lazy, unable to grasp the complex reality of modern industrial world. First-this is simply untrue, second-how can the man who was rejected everywhere remain active and not let his head down? Such nonsense has no place within our country. Schools shall be opened for everyone and education standartized throughout the nation, so that anyone could get the same quality and apply for the same job. In the world of fair business it matters little who you are, what really matters is how you get things done."
SAF_save_our_people_from_slums: "Save Our People From Slums"
SAF_save_our_people_from_slums_desc: "It wasnt just overpopulation, but also explicit racial divide that plagued our cities. While many white residents were spending their day in skyscrapers and lofty beaches, many Africans were stuck in slums and couldnt even get basic services due to crime and instability. Our new urban initiative however is to solve that. The open fields before us being the white canvas on which we can paint a perfect, or at least a better future. Clean and straight streets, parks, plumbing, business, industry and shopping districts will be arranged in organic matter so that when our citizen leaves his house, he is greeted with a beautiful scenery of progress and prosperity, driving away the bad thoughts."
SAF_away_from_the_hunger_map: "Away From The Hunger Map"
SAF_away_from_the_hunger_map_desc: "One of the stereotypes of Africa is that it is a place being ridden by famine. During the civil war that was true, we faced starvation in many parts of the country, and even during our Reconstruction the ration of many people could be considered "unfilfilling" at best. But with every day the plate and the glass are getting more and more full and diversified. With jobs came new the ability to buy, and with that came the ability to consume. Already the Hunger map is getting greener, investors return, smiles appear on the face of the laborers. This is the first step, but even it brought titanic results. South Africa is free from poverty, and while we are far from what we once were, we are surely getting there, sooner or later."
SAF_prepare_for_democracy: "Prepare For Democracy"
SAF_prepare_for_democracy_desc: "One of our first commitments was to Democracy and free elections. With the economic ruin gone, budget stabilized and better days ahead, people started to remind us of this fundamental promise. We will do that of course, but before we let the country sink into polemics, its best that we keep our eyes on the process itself. Democracy never was easy, especially in a place like Africa, and therefore it is better to be safe and sorry. "
SAF_consider_lifting_bans: "Consider Lifting Bans?"
SAF_consider_lifting_bans_desc: "Freedom of speech and expressions is beautiful, but it also brings in unwanted elements like political radicals on both ends of the spectrum. They are people like us, no doubt, but they also bring destructive ideas or even outright work against our democracy through lies and terrorism. However, should we compromise and guarantee some warm seats, not only will we get a powerfull ally, but also reassure the public that we are commited fully to our goal of liberty without compromises."
SAF_the_red_olive_branch: "The Red Olive Branch"
SAF_the_red_olive_branch_desc: "South African Communist Party and its multiple allies is a pain in the ass for sure, being indirectly funded by the Soviets and the Chinese. But that doesnt means its all doom and gloom. For while we dont agree with their message of wealth redistribution, we acknowledge that the Reds were the vanguard in the struggle against apartheid system. So, why dont we break some bread and secure this progressive force? At least if anyone will agree on a government position, they will be more focused on their former comrades rather than us."
SAF_the_orange_sword: "The Orange Sword"
SAF_the_orange_sword_desc: "The National Party may have been the one that spawned the whole mess of Apartheid, but to focus only on it would be a great mistake. While their racial views are less than pleasant, they and their allies were instrumental in keeping down the reds and keeping the country in one piece. Legalizing them may not be the best short-term strategy, but a large voting block of whites, including most of the rich and middle class would certainly help us in the future."
SAF_no_mercy: "No Mercy"
SAF_no_mercy_desc: "Whether the far-left or far-right, they are all the same! They dont want democracy and progress, they want barbarism and destruction for some false ideas of the last century. The SACP wants to hang all who are more well-off than they are, the National Party and her alikes wants to put segregation back into practice, we simply cant work if any of them remains active. There is no place for hateful being within our society and therefore no ban shall be lifted until the last of them surrenders their ideals!"

SAF_democracy_is_best_served_hot_desc: "Soon elections will commence and we must be ready. Parties are rallying, blocks and coalitons form and there is a sense of uncertainty in the air. However, its best to not wait any longer. Before any opposition can collect itself, its best to start elections now. That way they wont have time to do much, and remain in the dark, paving way for the moderates to take the scene."

Right now, there are 2 main alliances to pick from. On the left we have the People's Socialist alliance, formed out of the left-wing ANC and moderate socialists.

SAF_freedom_alliance_victory_desc: "....The Freedom Alliance. The voice of the reason is heard, and South Africa shall step on the way of true progress.

SAF_no_cabinet_majority: "No Cabinet Majority"
SAF_no_cabinet_majority_desc: "...No one. The Parliament is hung, surprisingly enough no party has the clear majority. While for a democracy it is normal, as it creates room for compromises and deals for both ends, within the current situation it could mean something much worse. With the political polarization still high, who knows what this will bring. Its better to hope that everything will be alright, after all-as long as it is peacefull and democratic."

But what would that accomplish? At the end of the day, the vast majority of wealth and the vast majority of land would remain under the control of the Boer!

SEY_MONETA.2.t: "Etched in History"
SEY_MONETA.2.desc: "Moneta sank down behind the burnt out off-road truck. With gritted teeth, he threw his broken sunglasses away from him and stretched out his left leg, the wound from the stray bullet pushed out a bit more blood. On the other side of the truck, the gruesome battle was still going on.\n\nIt had all started working out well: multiple soldiers would sneak towards an EFF-outpost and take out the guards sneaking through the woods north of Mthatha. Then the ground would attack from multiple sides trucks with mounted miniguns on trucks with a final tactical mortar strike taking out the command center. But as soon as the first trucks rolled into the woods, the ambushes started. Moneta's convoy also came into the ironsights of some of the insurgents with a bloody battle ensuing.\nThe old man pulled out his pocket knife and cut open his blood soaked pants before badly patching the undisinfected wound with his own scarf. His free hand slipped into his fanny pack, grabbing his painkillers and gulping down the pills all in one go.\nSuddenly, one of the other mercenaries climbed over the wreckage, landing right beside Moneta. The soldier looked at him, smiled in relief and stood up again.\n"Moneta's alive! Wounded but alive! Requesting ba...!"\nA loud bang hauled across the battlefield and the soldier sank down dead. Tullio grunted something in Italian about stupidity, before pulling his classic revolver out and loading it. He reached over to the soldier's body in hope of finding more bandages or even some disinfectant - but the only things he found were a cracked GPS device and a package of gum.\nThe mercenary cursed. The wound wouldn't stop spewing blood, his old bones weren't made for combat anymore and both his hands were shaky. Must be the damn artery. With the last strength he had, he leaned onto the wounded knee and closed his eyes. What happened to him? Did he become weak?\nA barely noticeable click was enough for the mercenary to get back from his trance and point his revolver at a young EFF soldier. He yelled some words in a language Moneta couldn’t possibly understand. Instead he loaded his revolver. A final shot hauled across the battlefield. The revolver slipped out of Tullio’s hand. Out of breath, he looked over to the dead EFF soldier.\n“Still got it. Knew it.”\n\nHis tired eyes slipped back up into the sky, a tired, yet happy smile forming on his old, dry lips. And finally, after years of fighting against the odds, a final breath escaped his mouth."

He had never raised his voice to her or complained if something wasn't 100% to his liking, but Marie of course noticed when the mercenary leader wasn't happy with his cake or the carefully folded shirts were a bit crinkly. The maid went through all the things again. The espresso, the cake, the pills and a glass of water. And of course his freshly washed handkerchief. Marie nodded happily, took the silver back up, walked to the door and knocked.\n\nNo response. She knocked again, but Tullio Moneta's private quarters remained silent. After a few more seconds, she decided to open the door herself. Moneta's armchair faced the open door towards the balcony.\n"Mister… mister Moneta?", the maid asked. The silver banged onto the floor while Marie rushed to the armchair - only to find the blank, pale face of Moneta.\nThe father of modern Seychelles laid dead in his leather chair.\nMarie stumbled backwards onto the table. Her shaky hands looked for a foothold on the wooden desk, only to push a bound book onto the floor. She leaned forward to pick it up, but hesitated at the last moment, leaving it alone."

AWB.99.t: "Fags In The City"
AWB.99.desc: "The whole scene felt absurd - key figures in the AWB huddled around the tiny screen of an iPhone intently watching some video, all wondering if they had somewhere more important to be?. The clip had been circulating around social media for a while now - really, it wasn't anything atypical. If anything, in a post-civil war environment where shock execution videos were so common, this one was tame. But one thing separated it from the milieu of BRF LiveLeak beheadings. It wasn't a war reprisal or a race attack, it wasn't in some plantation field or a desert. This was an attack *by* whites against *other* whites in the centre of Pretoria. Everyone was talking about it.\nThe clip started with a group of youths dressed in non-traditional fashion, some wearing explicit LGBTQ rainbow flag symbolism, before an off-screen voice yells "HEY FAGS!" Five figures emerge into frame dressed in attire typical of the AWB - skinhead outfits and triskelion Armbands. Then came the violence. A few minutes of crying, screaming, broken legs, fractured skulls that felt like an eternity. Five in intensive care, one permanently paralyzed from the neck down. Five million views already.\nSilence hung over the room as the clip ended. One of the ministers - a militia veteran - finally spoke. "A bloody public service if you ask me..." - a quick pause - "Fucking degenerates." Another quickly followed, "While obviously this sort of behaviour has no place in a stable homogenous society..." He looked around to gauge the reactions of the crowd, "I have to agree with our colleague on this, degeneracy like that will be the death of the Volkstaat." A longer pause and a murmur from the crowd. Another speaker. "what's even the point of a homogenous society if the streets aren't safe, disgusting as the victims lifestyles may be, they were whites, the *blood* of our state, and those attackers - they were acting like a bunch of fucking kaffers."\nThe discussion was over, the ministers looked to Steyn Von Rönge for any sort of verdict..."
