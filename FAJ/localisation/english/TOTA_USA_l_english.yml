He woke up once more in his bed, looking out of his meagre 4 inch window. He sat down in his meagre bed and looked at his meagre television.

His cell is climate-controlled and he hasn't left it in longer than he could remember. He's gone years and years within this high-tech 7 foot by 12 foot coffin, and he felt increasingly frail and depressed.\n\nHowever, something strange had just happened.\n\nHis window seemed to get larger.

A big problem when you aren’t. Gravel crunched under Johnson’s feet. The sun was refracted right into his eyes. Standing on the threshold, between the rocket and Earth, he felt the weight of everyone’s hopes, everyone’s expectations, more than the suit. \n\n “This is Commander Johnston of the SpaceX Columbus-7 mission.

A million words can be said about the resolve of the American people and their immense love for their country, but none other can best summarize it besides: Faith."\n\nAlex gently orders his papers, not looking at them for very long, turning back to the camera.\n\n"Our challenges, many they might be, but we cannot forget the accomplishments We, The People, have made. The landing and creation of the first moon base in Mars, a joint project between the Soviet Federation and the United States of America, is an unprecedented and incredible feat of international diplomacy and cooperation. We may be rivals in many ways, but we too are brotherly nations in a world that seeks to go forward. We must never forget, too, that we too have disagreements within our own country, our own rivalries. These are not, and will never be, enough to divorce us as a family..."\n\nThe rest of the speech elaborated on previous comments and continued on. A few mentions to President-Elect Sanders were made, but always more as a colleague than the President-Elect. Alex finished off his speech.\n\n"And so, my fellow citizens, thank you, and farewell. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."\n\nAlex quietly resigns to his room, the cameraman finishing the video and uploading it across several online channels and providing it to media networks. Alexander did not ponder his legacy much, or if he would be remembered with much zeal. He knew from the bottom of his heart that he did his best, and that Americans across the nation had listened in to his message. As the leader of the free world, there was nothing more Alex could ask for."

After a while of back and forth negotiations, they came to an nearly came to an agreement, but she ended up "souring the deal", at least that's what Charlie's texts one of the realtors cleared up, and she ended up verbally insulting him with some coarse language. It should have ended there, but the chief's nephew was with some radicals, we still haven't narrowed down the group yet, we'll be in an even worse situation if it's NAARP, and we haven’t gotten any word from our AIM contacts, so it’s still worrisome to that regard.\n\nEitherway, after the chief’s nephew overheard this from a relative or a friend, he gathered a few other young men and women and staked her out, kidnapped her, and then lynched her a few blocks away from her firm. Normally, this wouldn’t be that bad of a problem, at least in the context of a public lynching, but of course, knowing our recent luck,her husband happened to be in yet another one of those racially charged “homestead defense” groups, and tried to snoop around to figure out who was responsible. It all boiled over when the chief’s nephew tried to firebomb the firm, when one of the husband’s compatriots saw him and chased him down, though unsuccessfully. This all ended up culminating in that armed skirmish and explosion that managed to kill a few on both sides, the sheriff’s wont say how many, but some hospital records we got on hand give us an estimate of around 5-6 deaths and at least a dozen injuries.\n\nOverall, we need to figure out a response ASAP, that firm just so happens to be a perfect example of a key demographic we need in the coming elections, not to mention the type of capital connection we can end up losing over a “racially motivated” incident like this one. If we try to blame both sides, we’ll just end up giving more votes towards the freedomers, and our few progressive voters will just flock to reform or forward.
