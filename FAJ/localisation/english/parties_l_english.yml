natcom: "National Communism"
natcom_desc: "National Communism combines nationalism, be it civil or ethnic, with the theories of Marx, Engels and Lenin. Though Ceausescu's regime in Romania is often thought as being the incubator of National Communism many regimes such as Yugoslavia and Greece have also been described as National Communist. National Communist movements are in opposition to the "Kosyginite revisionism" of the USSR, instead embracing a nationalistic character to Marxism, often decried as "revisionism" itself. National Communist regimes are often quite diplomatically isolated, breeding many novel ideas.\n\n"The solving of domestic problems belongs exclusively to the Party and people of each country and any kind of interference can only do harm to the cause of socialism, friendship and collaboration among the socialist countries."\n-Nicolae Ceausescu"
insurrfash: "Insurrectionary Fascism"
insurrfash_desc: "A rare and esoteric ideology, Insurrectionary Fascism is primarily defined as the practical effect of revolutionary fascist ideologies which campaign for violent overthrows of established governments worldwide in favor of neo-Nazism and other racially-motivated far-right and third positionist ideologies. Whilst fundamentally an Insurrection cannot be a settled government, almost all Insurrectionary Fascist polities are borne out of civil chaos and war.\n\n"The purpose of life is to struggle as hard as you can for what you believe in and enjoy the struggle."\n-George Lincoln Rockwell"
greenpol: "Green Politics"
greenpol_desc: "\n\n\n£texticon_GreenPolitics\n\n\n\n\nMost commonly found in Europe, Green Politics encompasses the practice of Green, enviromentalist and anti-nuclear movements intermingled with progressivism and moderate left-wing economics. Also found in Japan, Green Politics are fundamentally tied to highly industrialized and developed societies.\n\n"I'm agnostic as to the causes. All I know is there is water where there once was ice."\n-Admiral Thad Allen"
nat_an: "National Anarchism"
nat_an_desc: "\n\n\n£texticon_NatAnarch\n\n\n\n\nA radical right-wing ideology, this strange viewpoint is almost hated by everyone across the political spectrum. The governments under this ideology are extremely socially and cultural traditional, attempting to return to a neo-tribal form of communes which are separated by race and in support of ethnic nationalism. This ideology has existed since at least the 1920s, but has been brought back to life by Troy Southgate in the West, and Koichi Toyama in the East, among others.\n\n"If you think you can change something by voting, you are completely wrong."-Toyama Koichi"
perdict: "Personalist Dictatorship"
perdict_desc: "\n\n\n£texticon_PersonalisticDictatorship\n\n\n\n\nA strange and usually nondescript type of governance centered around a single person's traits, charisma or otherwise attention-grabbing elements, ranging from the standard to the bizarre and eccentric. Most Personalist Dictatorships have almost no checks-and-balances or accountability, especially so towards the leader. They can range wildly in foreign policy and usually have economics leaning to the Right.\n\n\"Not even my worst enemy has ever accused me of being afraid to speak my mind.\"\n-Lee Kuan Yew"
demmarx: "Democratic Marxism"
demmarx_desc: "Prioritizing a transition to democracy and the rule of the people alongside a socialist revolution, Democratic Marxism rejects the usual doctrine of the “Dictatorship of the Proletariat” and “Whithering away of the State”, instead viewing Democratic reform to be of the utmost importance, taking place either directly during or immediately after the revolution.\n\n“Socialism as a means to the emancipation of the proletariat, without democracy, is unthinkable.”\n-Karl Kautsky"
class_soc: "Classical Socialism"
class_soc_desc: "Emanating from older currents of Soviet politics, Classical Socialism usually advocates for State control of the economy in the interest of the people, emphasizing investments in Agriculture, Consumer Goods, as well as light amounts of Liberalization and Cultural Exchange with the Western world.\n\n“Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you!”\n-Nikita Khrushchev"
consoc: "Conservative Socialism"
consoc_desc: "Conservative Socialism is unique in its rejection of more modern Socialism's embrace of Progressive narratives and values, putting the interest of the worker first, and often utilizing the rhetoric of embracing traditional values, in rejection of modern “Capitalistic Perversions”, and holds that a socialist society would be much more in line with a traditional lifestyle.\n\n“Modern systematic politics, whether liberal, conservative, radical or socialist, simply has to be rejected from a standpoint that owes genuine allegiance to the tradition of the virtues; for modern politics itself expresses in its institutional forms a systematic rejection of that tradition.”\n-Alasdair MacIntyre"
socnat: "Social Nationalism"
socnat_desc: "Social Nationalism combines elements from both the left and right to create an ideology of heavily Nationalistic, Popular Socialism, emphasizing the connection between the workingman and his country. These regimes often prioritize resisting the “Global Elite” through left-wing economic policies, as well as forms of Corporatism and Autarky.\n\n“We don't want people working in fast-food stands. We want them back in the steel mills.”\n-Lyndon LaRouche"
popsoc: "Populist Socialism"
popsoc_desc: "Arising out of anti-elitist, anti-corruption, and anti-capitalist sentiments in the past couple decades, Populist Socialism aims to protect the rights of and advance the interests of the common people and workers, usually advocating for large amounts of wealth redistribution, democratic reform, higher wages, and some degree of protectionism or alter-globalism.\n\n“We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don’t think that is the nation we should be living in.”\n-Bernie Sanders"
progano: "Progressive Anocracy"
progano_desc: "Often instated in order to protect Democracy, Civil Rights, and ensure Social Justice, Progressive Anocracies usually promise a return to full Democracy at some later date, no matter how indefinite their rule, and will often set out to use “any means necessary” to enforce their ideals.\n\n“Ultimately, being open and respectful towards each other is much more powerful as a way to diffuse hatred and anger than, you know, layering on, you know, big walls and oppressive policies.”\n-Justin Trudeau"
monitdem: "Monitored Democracy"
utopnat: "Utopian Nationalism"
utopnat_desc: "A idiosyncratic ideological framework mixing palingenesis, nostalgia for the Futurist movement and developments in neo-fascism as a whole, Utopian Nationalism seeks to etch and carve a modernistic, often revived national identity constructed around the glories of past empires or combinations of empires. Typically marked more by the fundamentals of cultural revolution than complex nuances in government, Utopian Nationalists often look towards a Marinettian approach to politics and can vary wildly on the issue of race and ethnicity.\n\n\"If the present were not so horrible and grim, and the future so mysterious and enigmatic, one could go mad with joy.\"\n\n-Konstantin Kavelin"
greencon: "Green Conservatism"
greencon_desc: "\n\n\n£texticon_GreenConservatism\n\n\n\n\nDistinguished from mainstream environmentalism in it's support of market-based, locally-minded solutions to issues such as climate change, Green Conservatism seeks to use the government to innovate and empower individuals with the capacity to do so.\n\n“The earth, the kind and equal mother of all ought not to be monopolised to foster the pride and luxury of any men.”\n-Edmund Burke"

Thus, it is impressive that in East Africa's nascent existence, there appeared to be a growth of interest in the ideas of local management and autonomous communes like in the Ujamaa system in 20th-century Tanzania. Despite this, however, it is very unlikely, if not impossible, for any East African anarchist organization to become relevant enough to be a force to be reckoned with.§!"

Through the years of fighting the Lord's Resistance Army, Yoweri's government had become increasingly dictatorial, and once Uganda's sovereignity dissolved, it appeared that everyone except Ugandans were celebrating.
