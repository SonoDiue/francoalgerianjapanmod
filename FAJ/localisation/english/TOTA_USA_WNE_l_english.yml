WNE.83.desc: "Grave news has emerged from the former United States today as "Fuhrer" Harold Covington has crushed the last organised resistance to his new empire. Although Idaho's National Socialist government had been preparing for an American collapse, they were truly not ready for the flowering of ambitious leaders within its cadres. Covington, a long time advocate of secession, was able to secure the leadership position after the death of former leader Dr. William Luther Pierce through a campaign across the countryside proclaiming that Pierce had been murdered. This assertion, though later proven false, gave him the political capital needed to march on Boise, and now, America. Though the young Reich has barely begun to take shape, reports are unveiling the retrofitting of FEMA camps for "political and racial enemies" of the new regime, as the American people slowly begin to accept their new fate under the bastard creed."

Sinema was widely considered an underdog in the conflict, but after the fall of the Pence and Pelosi coalitions, she was able to seize the Western Front and unite the Colorado River Valley.\nSinema has vowed a government of forgiveness and moderation, although it is likely that Ex-Leaders and Generals of Left-Wing factions have been captured. The USSR has so far remained fairly quiet over Sinema's alleged misuse of political force, seeking to retain the cordial relationship the two powers had previously enjoyed.\nIn many parts of the country the beleaguered American people by in large passively accept their new overlady and Sinema promises the ones that don't will soon see the way forward."

Not only has Milo proven controversial due to his lack of natural American citizenship and excessive, decadent and luxurious lifestyle, he has also proven to be an idiosyncratic and esoteric character. After the fall of Mike Pence by confusing and unclear circumstances, Milo has essentially crowned himself dictator of America by passing some of the most comprehensive and brutal amendments to the constitution seen since FDR. Besides the powergrab, Milo has done extensive reforms to elections, including extensive mental fitness tests to be allowed to vote. Despite an initial alliance with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, Milo's faction has superseded over all others and has begun eyeing to the "Resurgence and revitalization of the American Empire.""

Once deemed a traitor for his actions on January 6th and forced to flee, Obama is now hailed as an national hero from this heroic feat. Obama was able to seize the NYPD after a series of failed promises, including failing to move out into Philadelphia and other major cities along the Eastern Coast. Obama's charisma allowed him to talk NYPD officals into allowing a full scale takeover after his return from Cuba. Obama's left-wing populism and charisma was able to convince nearly a two hundred thousand young men and women to enlist in his armies. Obama's right hand, June Lapine has released a statement claiming that Obama's regime will maintain a mandate over America for as long as possible, but will begin to accept limited opposition."

Among other things, he promised an “American Economy” built by thriving businesses, a free market and the wellbeing of every citizen, calling all Americans to show resilience, strength and unity to work together to defeat the dangers of the ever-so-present threat of communism and socialism, as well as announcing the “Patriot Housing Act”, PH-Act for short, a governmental project which plans to expand suburbs and support so-called Home Owner Associations. \nEx-President Pence, who was forced to resign by the Supreme Court after a scandal following accusations of “unconstitutionalism”."

As soon as Kanye's faction, the "Birthday Party" as it was often named, successfully purged the others in glamorous trials against "sinful tyrants", he had quickly gotten to work and begun his Preidency with the proclamation of Jesus Christ as King of the Americas, the dissolution of the post of President, and the creation of the post of Protector-Regent of America. Whilst this immediately resulted in tired protests from the exhausted populace, enormous counter-protests arose in tandem. As the vista of chaos whizzed through the nation, Kanye had begun the process of revolutionizing America's political system towards a total Evangelical theocracy. The nation continues to burn in total anarchy, yet enthralled by the majesty of God's regent on Earth."

The USSR was quick to denounce this new state and the religion of Scientology, with Macron offering a less vitriolic condemnation.\nScientology, widely mocked and derided as a cult, is now in a position to greatly expand its influence as Scientologists now hold every major government position. Miscavige has even declared it to be the new Federation's state religion, though he is quick to quell fears of the formation of a a Scientologist theocracy.His inauguration, featuring the first public appearance of his wife since 2007, was met with performances by some of America's most influential musicians and was attended by a large portion of the rich and famous, with Tom Cruise rattling off a lengthy speech."

WNE.96.desc: "Strange news has seeped from Washington as the Second American Civil War has ended, although with an outcome few could expect. Marked by a confusing, idiosyncratic ideology, Jason Reza Jorjani couped the Yarvin government on the grounds of term limits and received wide-ranging support from multiple contradictory sources, ranging from left-wingers in California all the way to specific companies in Nevada. Fundamentally a Futurist of the Marinettian tradition, Jorjani has sought to completely and violently revolutionize American culture with a Zoroastrianist streak of aesthetics and Indo-European paganism. Not only has he turned 180-degrees on most American geopolitical alignments, including a newfound deep appreciation for the Hebrew Republic of Labour, but consistent and heartful contact with Soviet Eurasianist groups, all the while wishing to create a grandiose, romanticist and chaotic zeitgeist in the new American Social Republic."

Curtis Yarvin. Spencer has amassed popularity in Europeanist right-wing circles with his Francophile and borderline authoritarian policies, leading many to dub him the "American Macron". In his inauguration speech in Washington DC, Spencer vowed to restore order to the nation, return to normalcy and to re-evaluate the current policy and state of affairs.

WNE.94.desc: "Controversial California Governor Curtis Yarvin has declared himself "Transitional President of the American Corporate Patchwork" earlier today from the Governor's mansion in Sacramento, CA, following his victory in the Second U.S. Civil War. Yarvin, the Forward Party's highest-ranking official, has held his gubernatorial post since 2018 and has been supported and financed by his new Vice President, tech billionaire Peter Thiel, alongside many U.S. tech billionaires, Silicon Valley heavyweights and a major part of the American intelligentsia. Yarvin, a corporatist elitist but still socially libertarian, although very popular in his home state, will hardly resonate with the rest of the U.S. citizens. Reports say that he has already assembled a college of the wealthiest American businessmen, Fortune 500 executives, and academic scholars from the nation's most prestige universities in an effort to create a unitary body to rule the nation, per his manifesto, yet is still to be seen what his role will be in the new government."

Following the death of Dr. William Luther Pierce, James Mason was able to use his leadership of the National Socialist Liberation Front to outmaneuver other potential candidates for leadership of the Neo-Nazi rebellion in the west. In one of his first decrees in the \"National Socialist Revolution\", Mason has authorized the full execution of lethal force in order to execute the so-called \"Day of the Rope\": the execution of the damned. Already, roving cells of masked men have begun stringing up people at seemingly random, adorned with placards reading epithets such as "I defiled my race" or "I betrayed my race", a salient reminder of the new regime's creed. As soot and gunsmoke fill the air, one can only wonder the beast shall be satiated once fed, or if Mason's new regime will cannibalize itself in the future, as the swaying of a million nooses creak as one."

Although the word state is very generous here, as America is no more, with the Confederation of Autonomous Zones now speaking for 330 million people. Starting from urban riots in the city of Seattle, Antifa and its associates has brought anarchy to America, as power is devolved onto local levels, with cities and villages acting independently from each other, built off the principles of mutualism and anarcho-communism. Curiously enough, the new regime has declared a grand Cultural Revolution, to fight against the remnants of American culture, most of which is considered borderline Nazi by Gillis."

Campfires are lit, guitars are restrung, and rifles are polished; Commander Robert Jay Mathews of the American National Socialist Party has won the war. Yet the veneer of peace rests atop a violent foundation, as white citizen's militias begin clearing out any pockets of resistance, with various minority groups being subject to ethnic cleansing. Urban centers in particular are subject to large scale operations, aimed at "retaking our cities" from those deemed lesser. On the global stage, Mathews' regime has made no attempts at reconciliation, nor has any recognition been afforded — the American people will go it alone, blazing their own trail like their yeoman ancestors of old."

What was once an idealistic youth rebellion in Seattle now turned into a giant wasteland of terror as Aragorn's anti-civilization stance got a chance to manifest itself. Cities are turned into ruins, anarchy reigns in its true chaotic form and bloodshed is common across many parts of the country, with Aragorn himself claiming "final retribution against White settle colonialism", curiously enough, using the same repression methods against his former comrades on the left. The new regime has been almost universally condemned from all sides, as Soviets, Chinese, Europeans and Others declared "the death of once great nation, which has fallen to literal barbarism", as even global anarchist cells try to distance themselves as much as possible from the bloodthirsty maniac that now rules America."

As the sparks of rebellion grew into an all-consuming flame, one ember was able to outlast all the others: the Northwest Aryan Front. Led by President Greg Johnson, the American National Socialist Party has begun to rebuild the country in a new image, yet one that still lingers on the past. Indeed, Johnson himself has proclaimed that Americans will not be forced to bow to foreign creed, but rather, that the nation shall be able to express itself fully as the founders intended, unfettered and unshackled of "Zionist control." Already, hands are being outstretched to various groups across the nation, from Southern secessionists to American nationalists, attempting to bring all disparate sons of European stock under one fold. While not all accept such fascistic rhetoric, only time will tell whether Johnson's rebranding will simply be a new coat of paint, or something much more insidious."

But against all odds, in the end Lady Liberty prevailed, as Caryn Ann Harlos has proclaimed the rebirth of United States of America, in the shape that its founding fathers always intended. Internationally, the return of liberal government was met with praise throughout much of the world, with mild gestures of approval coming from Moscow and much more enthusiastic support from Tokyo and Paris.

Decrying the United States government as a spat on the Constitution and an insult to the Founding Fathers' ideals of democracy and personal liberty, Pence had made his gambit against Pelosi's dictatorship. As territory across the country was gained by Pence's militias, the chances of every other contender seemed increasingly unlikely.

When the violence had started in his home state, Shea managed to swiftly take back New York City one neighbourhood at the time, although with regard to the extreme number of accounts of police brutality and excessive force. Commissioner Shea's brilliant performance in the state of New York has gotten him support and pledges of loyalty from various police and national guard outfits across the USA, a part of the US Army remnants and even the FBI itself. Shea's abilities on the battlefield and a sizeable, trained and well-equipped army made easy work of the rest of the militias, armies and other groups across the nation as the Commissioner and his men managed to take back control of the country.

Whilst Pelosi's loyalist faction has won out in the end, it was nothing short of brutal. Hundreds of thousands, possibly millions have died since the beginning, with millions more at risk of starvation. Nonetheless, the United States has successfully survived, with expansive, wide-reaching trials across the political spectrum on grounds of treason and sedition.
