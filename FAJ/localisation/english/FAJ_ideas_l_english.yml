SBR_SBR_SDF:0 "The Siberian Defence Forces"
SBR_SDF_desc:0 "One of the few things great about this damned place is our suprisingly able Millitary, I mean hell they were so good that they literally overthrew the government. Although one thing is for sure is that the higher up are all egocentric scumbags- well disciplined, sure but damn is the leadership full of some pricks, of course because of them the politics of the government and millitary is very divided among the reformist, traditionalist and everyone in between. Seems like our Govenor General is trying to appease all sides by listening to them but theres gonna be one day where he has to pick a side."

SBR_general_rayyan:0 "The (Unpopular) General"
SBR_general_rayyan_desc:0 "Although unpopular our good friend here is that small ziptie holding our country together, his predecesor was a mad tyrant who saw Rayyan as a worthy kin to him. But instantly after his death, the General came out and said alot of things to his predecesor- mean, but true things about him. Because of this the General is more favorable to the people rather than the Junta government. For now this is tolarable for us, but if he steps out of line from either side, this country could to to hell."
