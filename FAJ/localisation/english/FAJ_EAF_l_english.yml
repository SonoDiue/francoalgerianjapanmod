EAF.1.d:0 "In the heart of East Africa, nestled within the resilient landscape of Ethiopia, a new nation was born from the embers of oppression and the yearning for freedom. The Trans-Femboy Federative Republic emerged as a beacon of hope for the trans people and femboys worldwide, symbolizing a bold new chapter in their fight for equality and liberty.\n\nFor years, trans people as well as femboys faced relentless persecution and oppression from governments around the globe. Their voices were silenced, their identities marginalized, and their existence denied. But after enduring enough subjugation, a collective uprising sparked a movement that could not be ignored. Immigrating to their promised land, Ethiopia, they found solidarity and strength, eventually toppling a sympathetic government that chose to step aside rather than suppress the rising tide of change.\n\nFrom the ashes of this coup, the TFFR was declared, heralding a new era where queerness was celebrated, not condemned. The council of the Trans-Femboy United Front, driven by their vision of a just society, took the reins of power with the promise of a sanctuary for all oppressed trans people and febmoys.\n\nThe journey to this sanctuary had been taxing, a long march through hostile lands and uncertain futures. Yet, despite the hardships, the community's spirit remained unbroken. Now, with the foundation of their republic laid, the TFFR faced the formidable task of building a nation from the ground up."
