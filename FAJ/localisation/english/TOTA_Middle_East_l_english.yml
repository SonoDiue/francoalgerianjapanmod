As Arab armies started to get closer and closer to Tel-Aviv-Yafo, and Jerusalem long fallen save for a few tiny pockets in the city's squares and old neighborhoods, The desperate and collapsing government of Israel enacted the most desperate response imaginable and launched hundreds of nuclear weapons against the Arab armies, and the largest cities and capitals of the agressing countries. Some countries have been devastated to the point of no salvation, with the casualties in the millions and entire cities, of immense historical significance have been pulverized to the ashes of the shortest scorched earth campaign the world had ever seen so far."

Our small country, beset on all sides since its conception, had to put a lot into wielding a proper force to defend itself, and the combination of the strong will and initiative of our soldiers with big investments into high-end equipment to arm them forged our undefeated EDF. But inside the ranks of our Army tensions are brewing, as many brave commanders who put their entire life into serving and protecting our country become increasingly dissatisfied with the current trends of reformism, and the new governments which they perceive as weak and traitorous. \n\n If the situation continues to develop in the wrong direction, the disgruntled officers may act to restore order."

The Dream of a safe home for the Jewish People in their land has been fulfilled, our efforts in the building of a country for us all have borne their fruits - but as our task is finished, the people, tired of war, stray from the ripe idealism on which our country was established, looking out to the new and changing world and leaving the future of our country uncertain."

With the establishment of our state, the collectivization and communalization of the economy yet intensified under the guide of our United Workers Party, along the uniquely Israeli interpretations of Socialism - the entire economy came under “Kibbutzi’im” (communal) principals. Surely, with the changing times we had to change and adapt as well, and indeed together with the rest of the progressive world we reformed our economy to adapt to the new circumstances of a new and changing world - state controls were loosened and markets came to operate to a growing extent, of course still under the close supervision of our Workers’ State."

ISP_ethnic_edati_divide_desc:0 "The conflict between Jews and Arabs in our country is well known worldwide, but little is heard about the rifts existing between the Jews themselves. With the old Yishuv composed mainly of European Ashkenazi Jews, the later arrival en masse of our brothers in the Middle East proved difficult for the economy, and their integration into the country was lackluster as they faced discrimination from the Ashkenazi-dominated institutions. Although the situation improved with time, to this day the divide stands, and Mizrahi Jews, typically living in lower socioeconomic conditions, are to a large degree alienated by the Labour Zionist establishment. Above all this still stands the problem of the non-jewish minorities in our country. Since the establishment of our country Palestinian Arabs constituted a significant minority, and with our absorption of palestinian populated territories in the 60’s the situation certainly did not improve. Surely, we gave all the minorities citizenship and they enjoy the same rights as the rest of the population, but still their integration faces difficulties, as Palestinian largely do not conscript into the EDF like the rest of the population, their living standards are lower, and Palestinian resistance, although low nowadays, is still existent to a degree."

He knows exactly what they're going to say - the most decorated soldier in the history of the EDF wouldn’t be blind to his very own party scheming against him.\nHe threw some water at his face and sighed deeply. He abandons the sink and looks towards the door, walking calmly to the podium, as to hear the accusations that were coming upon him.\nAnd, indeed - the Hebrew government had prepared a package of accusations and charges against Ehud Barak, hoping to get him to contest them and cause an embarassment for his reputation.\nEitan Ginzburg, a popular leader of young reformists and a known associate of Shalom Simhon, sneered at him with the force of a thousand suns, listing out allegations:\n"This assembly charges you with the accusation of profound corruption within the Histadrut's fund management, embezzling several million shekels into the pockets of your family members and your political clique, going as far as to bribe Mapam members into voting for you."\nEitan could barely contain his hatred of this fetid corrupt old man, and his clique of stagnant politicians that are dragging Eber down, keeping her from her true potential, holding her people back from true socialist liberty and progress. He, however, attempted to remain calm to others, maintaining the upper hand.\nIn a stark contrast to the calm and planned attack of Ginzburg, Almog Cohen of the Mizrahi Worker broke into the discussion, yelling: “Down with the gentile pedophile Barak!”\nThe murmurings suddenly stopped as silence fell in the room.\nEhud Barak broke the silence from his high position in the podium:\n“These allegations are shameful and false, and will be proven as such in court. However, as to secure the stability of the Democratic and Socialist course of our Republic and to avoid a division of our people, I will seek to follow the legal procedure to its full extent and to provide my resignation to this assembly and the Party.”\nEhud Barak was dismissed.

POLITICS_EHUD_BARAK_DESC:0 "Born in a Kibbutz in 1942, Ehud Barak is the face of an aging Status Quo. He joined the EDF in 1959, shortly into his service being spotted and taken to the new elite Sayeret Matkal. Even inside the elite unit Barak showed exceptional excellence, and became an officer after just one year, receiving a medal from the Ramatkal himself. His rise didn’t stop there, and as he took part in many important operations - often behind enemy lines - Barak rose further through the ranks, starting himself a successful military career. Commanding elite units and then divisions during crucial operations, Barak finally rose to the rank of Ramatkal before leaving the military in 1995. After leaving the military, Barak got into the civilian life, finding himself a comfortable position in the Histadrut, where he eventually rose to the board and then briefly served as its leader. From there, Barak naturally found his way into the higher circles of Mapam, getting elected to the People's Council in 2005. As the Mapam Center convened in 2017 to choose the new party premier - which was to be the prime minister of the country - Barak presented his candidacy, building on his reputation from the EDF and campaigning on a line of maintaining stability without leaning too much out of the current course of the country. Finally, in a close vote he was elected to the premiership of Mapam and soon after inaugurated as the new prime minister of Israel. Since then, Barak has overseen a silent period, keeping conflicts just below the surface as many opposing factions are just barely satisfied with the compromise he is."

While all the twentyfour individuals in the room all agreed that drastic change was needed within the country and especially within the party, the matter of what the reform should be, and who exactly would lead it, had been the key issue. The two leading candidates at this point were technocrat and agricultural-reformer Shalom Simhon, and the other was liberalization and democratization advocate Haim Ramon.\n\n‘Listen, with all respect to Ramon, he is too radical in his... vision, he's almost a crypto-capitalist. Simhon knows what is at the heart of the changing world and what we need to adopt to adapt, we need to digitize and automate our government and economy, and take back control of the schools and fields. Simhon can represent the entirety of the movement for change in the party, giving all its wings representation, instead of the narrow radicalism of Ramon.’ said one woman, clearly tired from yelling over different policies. Though as soon as she finished her sentence, the man sitting across from her began to speak over her. ‘Oh please, your messiah isn't going to turn lazy farmhands into a valley of plenty with a couple of robots. This isn't 1921, plowing fields isn't going to save us from stagnation. We need to free the economy and the people from this bureaucratic hell, and either way we have repeatedly offered Simhon the economic ministry, so save me your bullshit "crypto-capitalism" talk. We all acknowledge Simhon's... management skills.’\n\nThe room fell silent, a video call was coming in from both Simhon and Ramon.

Why shouldn't he tear down the oppressive and dictatorial monster the party has become? Ramon's cancer acts against the cruel beast of autocracy.’\n\nHaim Ramon laughed and turned away from the blog post written by a supporter possibly a bit too enthusiastic about his now-inevitable victory. He called to his aide, asking if Simhon was ready to arrange the final deal that would ensure his place in the history books. The aide nodded. Ramon opened a video call and waited around 10 seconds - 5 seconds too long - for Simhon to finally pick up. ‘I'm glad we could make this arrangement, Shalom. Thank you.’\n\nAs Ramon pretended to listen to Simhon, he opened another tab and began writing a message in his official supporters' RTC channel. ‘Soldiers, I am extremely happy to announce that the deal has been confirmed.

LEB.1.t: "A Proud People Again"
LEB.1.desc: "General Haz emerged on the balcony of Baabda Palace - not the official residence of Lebanon's president, but an old Ottoman mansion, surely a political statement - to greet the cheering crowd of socialist militiamen. He began his speech with a booming voice. "Long live Lebanon! Long live Communism! Death to the New British Empire! Death to Hebrew-Kosyginite revisionism!" The crowd went wild, they cared little for the Marxese he spewed but it was coming out the mouth of Haz al-Din, the Lion of Sidon.\nHe lowered his voice. "We must protect our faith and the will of all real Lebanese patriots. No longer will we, the Lebanese Nation, be subservient to the Social-Fascist Globalists in Jerusalem and Moscow!" The speech continued on with empty platitudes like these for some time. He felt the need to keep going, his people loved it, responding with great enthusiasm and fanfare.\n\nMeanwhile, in Jerusalem, the Foreign Minister, the Ramatcal, and the Head of the Mossad sat around in a dingy office, together with some of their closest aides. The panic in the air was suffocating as questions raced through their minds: What will happen to our boys in Beirut? What will happen to the republic? What will happen to us?\n\nShalom Simhon opened the door, his face twisted into a despondent frown;"

WNE.64.desc: "Seeing a surge of popularity in the massive protest movement that followed the Syrian coup attempt, the reformist movement headed by Michel Moawad has successfully consolidated it power in Lebanon, repelling both Syrian and Hebrew invaders, and is now quelling the last remnants of resistance.\n\nAlthough mostly Christian in its intial composition, this rather wide movement is representative of the nations youth and Intelligentsia, tired of the age old sectarian rule of geriatric nepotistic clans, and espousing in face of it a Europhilic, liberal and secular point of view. Firmly aligning itself with the European block and especially France, the new Lebanese Government seeks to rebuild and modernise the nation by promoting a civic, secular identity to de-emphasize sectarian drifts, and promises a truly sovereign, transparent, clean and efficient government."

WNE.166.t: "Kemalist Victory in Turkey [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.166.desc: "After a hard-fought civil war, the status-quo has proved once again to be more than capable of beating seemingly insurmountable odds. The “new” and victorious government led by Ekrem İmamoğlu and the CHP is making itself to be one that will push for peace and reconciliation. Organised along Democratic-socialist lines, the new Kemalists seek to establish détente with the Kurds and the Maoists in the country, whose insurgencies are still very much active. The stance on the military and Islamist opposition has been far harsher however, with many of the youths and students of Turkey blaming their anti-Communist paranoia for plunging the country into civil war. While the CHP looks to better relations with the soviet union, it will no doubt act tough on the right-opposition. As rabidly secularist reforms are put into place almost every day now, and countless businesses suspected of collaborating with the reaction are nationalised, Turkey begins the long long road to reconstruction."

WNE.167.t: "Communist Triumph in Turkey [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.167.desc: "Once a crucial lynchpin in containment, America's last real ally today sees shoals of Soviet battleships stream through the Dardanelles. The TKP has successfully outmanoeuvred the CHP in the halls of power, now relegated to a National Front party, and the reactionaries on the field of battle, now relegated to corpses. Though isolated terror cells linger in the hills, the average Turk can again live without fear of falling victim to bombing or gunfire.\n\nThe new regime has made clear that the war is over and that amnesties will be issued for the remaining militants. Despite grumbling over 'revisionist' policies, most Maoists and Kurds have laid down their arms and reintegrated into society. Flying against the government's assurances that all policies of war have been phased out, reports continue to emerge of the demolition of mosques and acts of brutality against Islamic clergy."

WNE.168.desc: "In the bustling cities of Turkey, as the dust of war settles on the ground, comes the noise of the future! The whirring of computers and clanging of machines fill the factories and government buildings as the TKP under the leadership of Örsan Şenalp and the Technocrats gears up for the tough task of a new administration. Originally a minority within the TKP, Örsan Şenalp’s Technocrats came to the forefront of Turkish politics having outmanoeuvred their opponents and capitalising on dissatisfaction among the Turkish populace on a lack of desire for radical reform among Republican candidates. Şenalp was able to wrestle control of the TKP away from those who towed the Moscow line. Instead moving towards a new Technocratic form of socialism drawing from the Vpered movement within the old Bolsheviks led by Bogdanov."

WNE.169.t: "Patriotic Socialist Revolution in Turkey [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.169.desc: "The outcome of the civil war has seen the Vatan Party win in Turkey, led by Doğu Perinçek. The newly formed government has set out to improve relations with the USSR and China, deepening their connection with the eastern world. They also have plans of economic revolution, restructuring the country’s market system. Organised along the lines of a staunchly Nationalist but still socialist revolution, the VP seems eager to cut off relations with the West and come crashing down on the Kurdish separatists in the East. Reports have emerged too of purges of Conservatives and Islamists within the army as accusations of commanders and bureaucrats working for Gladio or thoughts of a resurgent Ergenekon have provoked a wave of paranoia and finger pointing in the new republic. Either way, this victory represents an era of change for Turkey, whether it’s for better or for the worse, only time will tell."

WNE.170.t: "Third-Worldist National Revolution in Turkey [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.170.desc: "Coming from the ultra-left wing of the Vatan Party, a revolution of unprecedented radicalism and anger has burst out in Turkey. Following the ideology of the ‘National Left’, the National Party led by Gökçe Fırat Çulhaoğlu, has assumed control of Turkey. Declaring a new People’s Republic of the Turan, the UP aims for the alliance of the people of the Third World to revolt and conquer the First. Organised on Pan-Nationalist and staunchly Marxist principles, the UP aims to forge Turkey into a centre of anti-imperialism, that will support struggles for national liberation across the globe. Inspired by many Third World revolutionaries, from Galiev to Gaddafi, the UP aims to build an authentic communist revolution that is as nationalist as it is radical. While conflict in the east still continues, and as purges and executions of enemies of the revolution start to ramp up, it’s clear the new regime is here to stay."

WNE.171.t: "Turkey's Sacred Conspiracy Prevails [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.171.desc: "Strange days have found the nation of Turkey. A period of political chaos followed the TKP caused by the failure of either the Technocrats or more Orthodox party members to secure control of the Republic. Instead, another secret society has managed to unite enough Technocratic Communists and disillusioned radicals to form its own government. Against all odds, they have managed to push back against the Conservative forces of the East and unify Turkey once more. Led by Mete Ulaş Aksoy and inspired by the ideas of Georges Bataille, this new movement strives for the creation of a new Turkey inspired by ideals of mass sovereignty and the restructuring of all aspects of Turkish society and economy. This new surreal state of affairs will no doubt leave Turkey completely unrecognisable, come what may. As radical youths assemble in the streets, Turkey continues to race to an uncertain tomorrow."
