HON_football_humiliation:0 "La Humillacion"
HON_football_humiliation_desc:0 "The general malaise across Honduras after the decisive defeat in the Football War signified the end of Honduras' age in the early-to-mid 20th century as a wealthy and prosperous state, at least for Central American standards. The humiliating peace which resulted in the military occupation - which lasts to this day - of our southern territories, just outside of Tegucigalpa, is nothing short of horrid and painful for our population and political leaders, an issue which has marked our politics as vengeful, odious and violent. Regardlesss of our anger towards Salvadorans, it won't bring some of our most populated and prosperous territories back."
HON_population_loss:0 "Population Drain"
HON_population_loss_desc:0 "The population of Honduras has basically stayed the same since the 1960s. Not only that, but our population is the only one that's starting to decrease in all of Latin America. People flee Honduras through any attempt they can, and to remain a free country we cannot stop them. El Salvador accepts these people wholeheartedly, only then to keep them in bond to low wages and poor treatment, with trinket political protections keeping them from coming back to an even worse place - that being us. This feeling has only left us with the most ardent of nationalists, and thus has impregnated our politics with radicalism and violent hatred of Salvadorans."
HON_crippling_poverty:0 "Crippling Poverty"
HON_crippling_poverty_desc:0 "It's not like the refugees fleeing Honduras had much to bring with them, anyway. The country's been in a downward spiral since the 60s, and poverty keeps increasing through a terrifying and horrible vicious ouroboros of people fleeing, and thus the economy getting worse, and then more people fleeing. Unless we do something urgent about our situation, perhaps we will become one of the poorest countries in Latin America, to rival Haiti."
ELS_waning_victories:0 "Waning Victories"
ELS_waning_victories_desc:0 "Our grandiose victories in the past wars and conflicts with Honduras have allowed us a boon in territorial gains (with the military occupation to our north being legally Salvadoran territory), wealth, people, and a feeling of happiness throughout our entire population. Yet, the younger generations feel little of these victories, having most of the wealth yet to trickle to them. Not only this, but our constant militarism and fierce nationalism surely worries some of our more liberal-minded youth. Our military parades prove controversial in social media, with a number of youth defending our soldiers, whilst a bigger number just wonders -\n\nwhy do we need all this?"
ELS_expensive_occupation:0 "Expensive Occupation"
ELS_expensive_occupation_desc:0 "In tandem with the arguments used by our youth against the country's military is an immense sink of our money - the occupation of La Paz Del Salvador, our newest province (under most-likely-permanent military occupation). Skirmishes with socialist guerillas in the mountains, loss of life and curfews generally hurt our settlers and even our core population in how they see the military of this country. Whilst nominally most of the country supports us, the feeling that we might be using too much of our budget on guns and not on schools worries a similar majority."
ELS_anticom_beacon:0 "Anticommunist Beacon"
ELS_anticom_beacon_desc:0 "Podcasts, internet videos, movies and everything in between promotes our hatred of communism to a redundant and emotional degree. People across El Salvador barely have any common ideas on what communism is, but they really do hate it."
EMR_farabundist_haven:0 "Farabundist Haven"
EMR_farabundist_haven_desc:0 "El Salvador likes to send the great social rejects of the country to us, in the hopes of increasing Salvadoran populations and also removing problematic elements from the mainland, and reforming them through a military modus operandis. Thankfully they've been mostly kept in good order with wealth and happiness, but many of these people at the edge of Salvadoran society also have immense Farabundist and socialist leanings. Therefore, many of them use the opportunity to be sent to our Military Region deliberately so they can cause trouble for the military and civilian governments. We've been keeping them to demarcated lines in the mountains mostly, but it's still a lot of baggage to deal with for a small army like ours, especially one that has to deal with remnants of Honduran populations and refugees dripping into our territory, causing recruitable numbers to be generally very low in nearly every monthly report."

WNE.11.t: "The Honduran Revenge! [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.11.desc:0 "The Honduran people had been consistently humiliated and castrated through the decades by the consistent draconian and hostile clauses of a conflict from decades prior. These measures had proven to further radicalize the Honduran people to the point of electing ultranationalists to their government, which had most of their government's political beliefs involve revanchism in all elements of society, nicknamed the "10 Revenges". The inevitable war that occured was split in support and detraction across the United Nations. As the dust settles, Hondurans are marching through previously taken lands, and have went another step forward - proclaiming the Federal Republic of Central America, with the capital at Tegucigalpa."

WNE.12.t: "El Salvador repels Honduras [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.12.desc:0 "El Salvador, many decades ago, had made a victorious gamble against the government of Honduras once it was found out that Salvadoran immigrants were being harassed and murdered by Hondurans in the border, culminating with the football games of the 1960s. They had gained a massive boon of land, population, wealth and many other things from the war, as Hondurans bled their previous prosperity dry. Yet, when an ultranationalist government was elected in Honduras, war seemed inevitable - and yet, despite unthinkable sacrifice, the Hondurans have failed in their ambitions. Nonetheless, El Salvador's President, Nayib Bukele, has revealed his plans to unify all of Central America under him now, with other countries on the chopping block."

MSK_successfully_free: "Successfully Free!"
MSK_successfully_free_desc: "Despite the overwhelming odds, with the aid of our benefactors and the merciless resolve of our people, we've expelled the Hispano-Communists that held us in chains for decades and successfully freed the Commonwealth of the Miskito Nation. While our challenges may be many, including the lack of international recognition, with the patriotic force of our people, we are sure of our success."

WNE.189.t: "Miskito Nation unifies Central America [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.189.desc: "In an incredible and unpredictable turn of events, the Commonwealth of Miskito has successfully, side by side with Nicaraguan Contras, unified the region of Central America. Despite commanding less than 600,000 Miskito and an unlikely starting situation, the Miskito people have used their position as the primary military base for Contra operations, clawing through the rest of Central America in patriotic anti-communist fervor. Now, the Head Chief of the Miskito Nation, Hendy Clarence, has proclaimed the \"United Communitarian Kingdom of Central America\", a deeply unusual mix of Republicanism and Monarchy glued together using the Westminster System, alongside English as a lingua franca."
WNE.189.a: "Deeply unusual."

WNE.190.t: "Hondurans unify Central America [GetNewsGraphic]"
WNE.190.desc: "Despite a dying economy and authoritarian government, the Hondurans have successfully wiped out all nearby competition and created the pro-Tokyo Federal Republic of Central America. Styling itself as a beacon of anti-Communism in the region, the Tegucigalpa regime has since eased its worst excesses of authoritarianism whilst adopting techno-managerialist elements to further please Japanese and Manchukuoan delegates. After two centuries, the Central Americans have once become a single voice, centered in Tegucigalpa in the Honduran mountains."

WNE.191.desc: "The outcome many predicted and expected, from within Central America and internationally, Nayib Bukele's Salvadoran regime has successfully unified Central America as promised by his administration. After an initial war with Honduras resulting in a decisive Salvadoran victory, Bukele's intentions of creating a Central American republic had become public knowledge and after demanding other nearby polities to accept an agreement which would create a single Central American state, San Salvador has succesfully brought all of Central America under one voice, with the notable exception of the Miskito, who've been left to their own devices..."

WNE.192.desc: "Despite a dwindling economy and a Miskito Coast-sized problem within their legally recognized borders, the Nicaraguan Sandinistas have successfully journeyed through Central America and proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Centroamerica. As international observers look in shock, expecting that the pariah state would collapse at some point, the Sandinistas persisted and thrived on the rubble of their enemies. Despite their markedly less market-friendly nature, the Nicaraguans have stated their clear intent of aligning with Soviet interests, although more towards the Romanian tendency as a \"necessary creative development for building socialism\"."
