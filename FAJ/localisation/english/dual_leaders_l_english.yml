 ROM_VALENTIN_CEAUSESCU_TITLE:0 "President of Romania \n\nIdeology: No Ideology\n\nValentin Ceaușescu exists more as a Chinese Emperor than actual statesman, rarely appearing in public for diplomatic, political and social events. The few times he does appear, he is greeted by an unending sea of supporters, of desperate ideologues ready to hear whatever pre-written script he is going to read out this time, with his soft-spoken, rasping voice. Indeed, most of Valentin's time is spent reading, appreciating art and writing treatises on nuclear energy, possibly the only real stance he has that is his own, and not just trailings of his larger-than-life forefather. Having been thrusted into the seat of President by the untimely death of his younger brother Nicu, Valentin has been largely hapless and apathetic towards the political machinations happening in the country he is supposed to rule with an autocratic fist. Nonetheless, some designs and plans do exist within Valentin's palace. Whilst almost all of his true views have been placed lock-and-key within the crevices of his own mind, the red grand court that surrounds him is more than happy to simply continue ceremonialisms and routines..."

  TAG_decisions_for_mobilization_cat_desc: "War has always been a part of human history, ever since the dawn of man even, but as humanity moves forward into the 21st century, warfare has largely been neglected and diminished in favor of peaceful diplomatic reconciliation, trade deals and other approaches, not to mention the destructive, economically expensive side of war, which is increasingly unpopular with the public. All of these issues and advances in diplomacy have created a difficult time for mass mobilization in our Armed Forces. Nonetheless, in the event of an existential threat to our society and government, it is imperative that we prepare for war. Therefore, pursuing some mobilization in the event of threats can be useful, as we can't immediately expand our army without some costs."

   NGA_nom_tt: "Opens the Nigeria-o-Meter, which deals with regional politics."
   NGA_meter_faq: "The Nigeria-o-Meter is a chart that illustrates the attitude of our government toward the major ethnoreligious groups inside Nigeria: Muslims, the majority from the north and the Christian minority in Lagos and other areas in the south. Depending on our actions, territorial expansion and more, we are able to gain further favors from either side. This includes things like enacting legislation or completing a project - this helpful chart shows where our government stands in the issue of ethnoreligious balance, and the benefits and negative effects of our choices. Alternatively, we can try to work our way out of this dichotomy, instead focusing on creating a true governmental neutrality. Let's choose carefully who we align with."
